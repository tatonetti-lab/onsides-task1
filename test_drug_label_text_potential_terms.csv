  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Visceral Leishmaniasis  



 One Phase 3 trial was conducted in patients >= 12 years of age in India. Two-hundred and ninety-nine (299) patients (211 men and 88 women) received oral IMPAVIDO at a target dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days (50 mg capsule once daily if weight was less than 25 kg and 50 mg capsule twice daily if weight was 25 kg or greater). Patients ranged between 12 and 64 years of age. Weight ranged between 15 and 67 kg (mean weight 38.6 kg) and BMI ranged between 8.2 and 24 (mean 16.1). Ninety-nine (99) patients received 1 mg/kg/day amphotericin B deoxycholate intravenously every other day for 15 doses. A statistically significant higher percentage of men received IMPAVIDO compared to amphotericin B.



  Less than 1% of patients who received IMPAVIDO died (2/299) and no patient who received amphotericin B died. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 2% of IMPAVIDO recipients (6/299) and 1% of amphotericin B recipients (1/99). Approximately 3% of patients discontinued treatment in each treatment arm due to an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation that were thought to be related or possibly related to IMPAVIDO included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, melena and thrombocytopenia, arthritis and skin rash, CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 4 diarrhea (>=10 stools per day) and CTCAE Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia (>=10x upper limit of normal ULN).

         In this study, creatinine (Cr) elevations >= 1.5 times above baseline occurred in approximately 10% of IMPAVIDO recipients and in 40% of amphotericin B recipients at the end of therapy. Ten percent of subjects in each arm had Cr elevations >=1.5 times above baseline at 6 months follow up. No IMPAVIDO recipient discontinued therapy due to Cr elevation.
 

 Elevations of transaminases during therapy occurred in up to half of IMPAVIDO recipients and up to a third of amphotericin B recipients. The elevations were mild (< 3x ULN) or moderate (3-5x ULN) in 94% and 6% respectively of IMPAVIDO-treated patients who experienced an elevation. No patient discontinued therapy due to elevations in transaminases.



 At the end of therapy, 62% and 2.4% of IMPAVIDO recipients and 54% and 2% of amphotericin B recipients had platelet count < 150,000 and < 50,000 respectively.



   Cutaneous Leishmaniasis  



 The efficacy of IMPAVIDO in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis was evaluated in one placebo-controlled trial conducted in Colombia and Guatemala and in two comparative trials conducted in Bolivia and Brazil respectively. In the placebo-controlled trial, eighty-nine (89) patients >=12 years of age received a target IMPAVIDO dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days and forty-four (44) received placebo. In the comparative trials, one hundred and twenty (120) patients >=12 years of age received a target IMPAVIDO dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days and fifty eight (58) patients received 20 mg/kg/day pentavalent antimony (meglumine) parenterally for 20 days.

   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Miltefosine may cause fetal harm. Embryo-fetal toxicity, including death and teratogenicity, was observed in animals administered miltefosine prior to mating, during early pregnancy, and during organogenesis at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Do not use IMPAVIDO in pregnant women. Obtain a urine or serum pregnancy test prior to prescribing IMPAVIDO to females of reproductive potential. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IMPAVIDO therapy and for 5 months after completion of therapy [see  Boxed Warning  , Contraindications (  4.1  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.8  )]  .



    5.2 Reproductive Effects



   Females  



 Miltefosine caused impaired fertility in rats and reversible follicular atresia and diestrus in dogs at doses approximately 1.0 and 0.2 times respectively the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1  )]  . Effects on human female fertility have not been formally studied.



  Males  



 Miltefosine caused reduced viable sperm counts and impaired fertility in rats at doses approximately 0.4 times the MRHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1    ) ]  . A higher dose in rats, approximately 1.0 times the MRHD, caused testicular atrophy and impaired fertility that did not fully reverse 10 weeks after drug administration ended.



 Scrotal pain and decreased or absent ejaculation during therapy have been reported during IMPAVIDO therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2    ) ]  . The effects of IMPAVIDO on human male fertility have not been adequately studied.



 Advise women and men of the animal fertility findings, and that the potential for impaired fertility with IMPAVIDO therapy in humans has not been adequately evaluated.



    5.3 Renal Effects



  Elevations of serum creatinine (Cr) were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of cutaneous, mucosal and visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor renal function weekly in patients receiving IMPAVIDO during therapy and for 4 weeks after end of therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.4 Hepatic Effects



  Elevations in liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin during therapy in patients receiving IMPAVIDO [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.5 Gastrointestinal Effects



  Vomiting and/or diarrhea commonly occur during IMPAVIDO administration and may result in volume depletion. Encourage fluid intake to avoid volume depletion [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.6 Thrombocytopenia



  Thrombocytopenia during therapy has been reported in patients treated for visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor platelet count during therapy for visceral leishmaniasis [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  .



    5.7 Absorption of Oral Contraceptives



  Vomiting and/or diarrhea occurring during IMPAVIDO therapy may affect the absorption of oral contraceptives, and therefore compromise their efficacy. If vomiting and/or diarrhea occur during IMPAVIDO therapy, advise females to use additional non-hormonal or alternative method(s) of effective contraception.



    5.8 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome



  Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported during IMPAVIDO therapy. Discontinue IMPAVIDO if an exfoliative or bullous rash is noted during therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical studies on LIVALO are conducted in varying study populations and study designs, the frequency of adverse reactions observed in the clinical studies of LIVALO cannot be directly compared with that in the clinical studies of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and may not reflect the frequency of adverse reactions observed in clinical practice.



 Adverse reactions reported in >= 2% of patients in controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than or equal to placebo are shown in  Table 1  . These studies had treatment duration of up to 12 weeks.

           Other adverse reactions reported from clinical studies were arthralgia, headache, influenza, and nasopharyngitis.
 

 The following laboratory abnormalities have also been reported: elevated creatine phosphokinase, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and glucose.



 In controlled clinical studies and their open-label extensions, 3.9% (1 mg), 3.3% (2 mg), and 3.7% (4 mg) of pitavastatin-treated patients were discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: elevated creatine phosphokinase (0.6% on 4 mg) and myalgia (0.5% on 4 mg).



 Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, and urticaria have been reported with LIVALO.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of LIVALO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Adverse reactions associated with LIVALO therapy reported since market introduction, regardless of causality assessment, include the following: abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, asthenia, fatigue, malaise, hepatitis, jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, dizziness, hypoesthesia, insomnia, depression, interstitial lung disease, erectile dysfunction and muscle spasms.



 There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).



 There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see  Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )  ].

LIVALO,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis): Risks increase in a dose-dependent manner, with advanced age (>=65), renal impairment, and inadequately treated hypothyroidism. Advise patients to promptly report unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, and discontinue LIVALO (  5.1  ) 
 *   Liver enzyme abnormalities: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Skeletal Muscle Effects



   Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including LIVALO.  These risks can occur at any dose level, but increase in a dose-dependent manner.



 LIVALO should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy. These factors include advanced age (>=65 years), renal impairment, and inadequately treated hypothyroidism. The risk of myopathy may also be increased with concurrent administration of fibrates or lipid-modifying doses of niacin. LIVALO should be administered with caution in patients with impaired renal function, in elderly patients, or when used concomitantly with fibrates or lipid-modifying doses of niacin [see Drug Interactions (  7.6  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ,  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  



 Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing LIVALO with colchicine [see Drug Interactions  (  7.7  )].



 There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use.  IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents.



 LIVALO therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. LIVALO therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). All patients should be advised to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing LIVALO.



    5.2 Liver Enzyme Abnormalities



  Increases in serum transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including LIVALO. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy.



 In placebo-controlled Phase 2 studies, ALT >3 times the upper limit of normal was not observed in the placebo, LIVALO 1 mg, or LIVALO 2 mg groups. One out of 202 patients (0.5%) administered LIVALO 4 mg had ALT >3 times the upper limit of normal.



 It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before the initiation of LIVALO and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur.



 There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with LIVALO, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart LIVALO.



 As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, LIVALO should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent transaminase elevations, is a contraindication to the use of LIVALO [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



    5.3 Endocrine Function



  Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including LIVALO.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 During its development, XENAZINE was administered to 773 unique subjects and patients. The conditions and duration of exposure to XENAZINE varied greatly, and included single and multiple dose clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers (n=259) and open-label (n=529) and double-blind studies (n=84) in patients.



 In a randomized, 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trial of HD patients, adverse reactions were more common in the XENAZINE group than in the placebo group. Forty-nine of 54 (91%) patients who received XENAZINE experienced one or more adverse reactions at any time during the study. The most common adverse reactions (over 10%, and at least 5% greater than placebo) were sedation/somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, depression, akathisia, anxiety, and nausea.



     Adverse Reactions Occurring in >=4% of Patients  



 The number and percentage of the most common adverse reactions that occurred at any time during the study in >=4% of XENAZINE-treated patients, and with a greater frequency than in placebo-treated patients, are presented in Table 1.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING:  DEPRESSION AND SUICIDALITY

    WARNING:  DEPRESSION AND SUICIDALITY  

    XENAZINE can increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior (suicidality) in patients with Huntington's disease. Anyone considering the use of XENAZINE must balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for control of chorea. Close observation of patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior should accompany therapy. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risk of depression and suicidality and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician.   



   Particular caution should be exercised in treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation, which are increased in frequency in Huntington's disease. XENAZINE is contraindicated in patients who are actively suicidal, and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression   [see   Contraindications (4)  ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .

   5.1 Clinical Worsening and Adverse Effects



  Huntington's disease is a progressive disorder characterized by changes in mood, cognition, chorea, rigidity, and functional capacity over time. In a 12-week controlled trial, XENAZINE was also shown to cause slight worsening in mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity. Whether these effects persist, resolve, or worsen with continued treatment is unknown.



 Prescribers should periodically re-evaluate the need for XENAZINE in their patients by assessing the beneficial effect on chorea and possible adverse effects, including depression, cognitive decline, parkinsonism, dysphagia, sedation/somnolence, akathisia, restlessness and disability. It may be difficult to distinguish between drug-induced side-effects and progression of the underlying disease; decreasing the dose or stopping the drug may help the clinician distinguish between the two possibilities. In some patients, underlying chorea itself may improve over time, decreasing the need for XENAZINE.



    5.2 Depression and Suicidality



  Patients with Huntington's disease are at increased risk for depression, suicidal ideation or behaviors (suicidality). XENAZINE increases the risk for suicidality in patients with HD. All patients treated with XENAZINE should be observed for new or worsening depression or suicidality. If depression or suicidality does not resolve, consider discontinuing treatment with XENAZINE.



 In a 12-week, double-blind placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with Huntington's disease, 10 of 54 patients (19%) treated with XENAZINE were reported to have an adverse event of depression or worsening depression compared to none of the 30 placebo-treated patients. In two open-label studies (in one study, 29 patients received XENAZINE for up to 48 weeks; in the second study, 75 patients received XENAZINE for up to 80 weeks), the rate of depression/worsening depression was 35%.



 In all of the HD chorea studies of XENAZINE (n=187), one patient committed suicide, one attempted suicide, and six had suicidal ideation.



 Clinicians should be alert to the heightened risk of suicide in patients with Huntington's disease regardless of depression indices. Reported rates of completed suicide among individuals with Huntington's disease ranged from 3-13% and over 25% of patients attempt suicide at some point in their illness.



 Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risks of depression, worsening depression, and suicidality associated with XENAZINE and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. Patients with HD who express suicidal ideation should be evaluated immediately.



    5.3 Laboratory Tests



  Before prescribing a daily dose of XENAZINE that is greater than 50 mg per day, patients should be genotyped to determine if they express the drug metabolizing enzyme, CYP2D6. CYP2D6 testing is necessary to determine whether patients are poor metabolizers (PMs), extensive (EMs) or intermediate metabolizers (IMs) of XENAZINE.



 Patients who are PMs of XENAZINE will have substantially higher levels of the primary drug metabolites (about 3-fold for alpha-HTBZ and 9-fold for beta-HTBZ) than patients who are EMs. The dosage should be adjusted according to a patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status. In patients who are identified as CYP2D6 PMs, the maximum recommended total daily dose is 50 mg and the maximum recommended single dose is 25 mg [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  



    5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)



  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with XENAZINE and other drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.12)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.6)  ].  Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnosis of NMS can be complicated; other serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection), and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal disorders can present with similar signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.



 The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of XENAZINE and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.



 Recurrence of NMS has been reported. If treatment with XENAZINE is needed after recovery from NMS, patients should be monitored for signs of recurrence.



    5.5 Akathisia, Restlessness, and Agitation



  In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, akathisia was observed in 10 (19%) of XENAZINE-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. In an 80-week open-label study, akathisia was observed in 20% of XENAZINE-treated patients. Akathisia was not observed in a 48-week open-label study. Patients receiving XENAZINE should be monitored for the presence of akathisia. Patients receiving XENAZINE should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of restlessness and agitation, as these may be indicators of developing akathisia. If a patient develops akathisia, the XENAZINE dose should be reduced; however, some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.



    5.6 Parkinsonism



  XENAZINE can cause parkinsonism. In a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism (i.e., bradykinesia, hypertonia and rigidity) were observed in 15% of XENAZINE-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 48-week and 80-week open-label studies, symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism were observed in 10% and 3% of XENAZINE-treated patients, respectively. Because rigidity can develop as part of the underlying disease process in Huntington's disease, it may be difficult to distinguish between this drug-induced side-effect and progression of the underlying disease process. Drug-induced parkinsonism has the potential to cause more functional disability than untreated chorea for some patients with Huntington's disease. If a patient develops parkinsonism during treatment with XENAZINE, dose reduction should be considered; in some patients, discontinuation of therapy may be necessary.



    5.7 Dysphagia



  Dysphagia is a component of HD. However, drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission have been associated with esophageal dysmotility and dysphagia. Dysphagia may be associated with aspiration pneumonia. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, dysphagia was observed in 4% of XENAZINE-treated patients and 3% of placebo-treated patients. In 48-week and 80-week open-label studies, dysphagia was observed in 10% and 8% of XENAZINE-treated patients, respectively. Some of the cases of dysphagia were associated with aspiration pneumonia. Whether these events were related to treatment is unknown.



    5.8 Sedation and Somnolence



  Sedation is the most common dose-limiting adverse reaction of XENAZINE. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with chorea associated with HD, sedation/somnolence occurred in 17/54 (31%) XENAZINE-treated patients and in 1 (3%) placebo-treated patient. Sedation was the reason upward titration of XENAZINE was stopped and/or the dose of XENAZINE was decreased in 15/54 (28%) patients. In all but one case, decreasing the dose of XENAZINE resulted in decreased sedation. In 48-week and 80-week open-label studies, sedation/somnolence occurred in 17% and 57% of XENAZINE treated patients, respectively. In some patients, sedation occurred at doses that were lower than recommended doses.



 Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness to maintain the safety of themselves or others, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery, until they are on a maintenance dose of XENAZINE and know how the drug affects them.



    5.9 QTc Prolongation



  XENAZINE causes a small increase (about 8 msec) in the corrected QT (QTc) interval. QT prolongation can lead to development of torsade de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia with the risk increasing as the degree of prolongation increases [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ].  The use of XENAZINE should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc, including antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide), and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or any other medications known to prolong the QTc interval [see  Drug Interactions (7.5)  ].  



 XENAZINE should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ].  



    5.10 Hypotension and Orthostatic Hypotension



  XENAZINE induced postural dizziness in healthy volunteers receiving single doses of 25 or 50 mg. One subject had syncope and one subject with postural dizziness had documented orthostasis. Dizziness occurred in 4% of XENAZINE-treated patients (vs. none on placebo) in the 12-week controlled trial; however, blood pressure was not measured during these events. Monitoring of vital signs on standing should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.



    5.11 Hyperprolactinemia



  XENAZINE elevates serum prolactin concentrations in humans. Following administration of 25 mg to healthy volunteers, peak plasma prolactin levels increased 4- to 5-fold. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if XENAZINE is being considered for a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia and impotence can be caused by elevated serum prolactin concentrations, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin concentrations for most patients is unknown. Chronic increase in serum prolactin levels (although not evaluated in the XENAZINE development program) has been associated with low levels of estrogen and increased risk of osteoporosis. If there is a clinical suspicion of symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, appropriate laboratory testing should be done and consideration should be given to discontinuation of XENAZINE.



    5.12 Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)



  A potentially irreversible syndrome of involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with neuroleptic drugs. In an animal model of orofacial dyskinesias, acute administration of reserpine, a monoamine depletor, has been shown to produce vacuous chewing in rats. Although the pathophysiology of tardive dyskinesia remains incompletely understood, the most commonly accepted hypothesis of the mechanism is that prolonged post-synaptic dopamine receptor blockade leads to supersensitivity to dopamine. Neither reserpine nor XENAZINE, which are dopamine depletors, have been reported to cause clear tardive dyskinesia in humans, but as pre-synaptic dopamine depletion could theoretically lead to supersensitivity to dopamine, and XENAZINE can cause the extrapyramidal symptoms also known to be associated with neuroleptics (e.g., parkinsonism and akathisia), physicians should be aware of the possible risk of tardive dyskinesia. If signs and symptoms of TD appear in a patient treated with XENAZINE, drug discontinuation should be considered.



    5.13 Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues



  Since XENAZINE or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues, it could accumulate in these tissues over time. This raises the possibility that XENAZINE may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Neither ophthalmologic nor microscopic examination of the eye was conducted in the chronic toxicity study in dogs. Ophthalmologic monitoring in humans was inadequate to exclude the possibility of injury occurring after long-term exposure.



 The clinical relevance of XENAZINE's binding to melanin-containing tissues is unknown. Although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmologic monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ].

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 During clinical development, approximately 2570, 2040, and 1220 patients with either IBS-C or CIC were treated with LINZESS for 6 months or longer, 1 year or longer, and 18 months or longer, respectively (not mutually exclusive).



     Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)  



     Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 The data described below reflect exposure to LINZESS in the two placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 1605 adult patients with IBS-C (Trials 1 and 2). Patients were randomized to receive placebo or 290 mcg LINZESS once daily on an empty stomach for up to 26 weeks. Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  .    Table 1    provides the incidence of adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of IBS-C patients in the LINZESS treatment group and at an incidence that was greater than in the placebo group.

             Diarrhea  
 

 Diarrhea was the most commonly reported adverse reaction of the LINZESS-treated patients in the pooled IBS-C pivotal placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, 20% of LINZESS-treated patients reported diarrhea compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 2% of the LINZESS-treated patients versus less than 1% of the placebo-treated patients, and 5% of LINZESS-treated patients discontinued due to diarrhea vs less than 1% of placebo-treated patients. The majority of reported cases of diarrhea started within the first 2 weeks of LINZESS treatment. Fecal incontinence and dehydration were each reported in less than or equal to 1% of patients in the LINZESS treatment group  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  



 In placebo-controlled trials in patients with IBS-C, 9% of patients treated with LINZESS and 3% of patients treated with placebo discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the LINZESS treatment group, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were diarrhea (5%) and abdominal pain (1%). In comparison, less than 1% of patients in the placebo group withdrew due to diarrhea or abdominal pain.



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Dose Reductions  



 In the open-label, long-term trials, 2147 patients with IBS-C received 290 mcg of LINZESS daily for up to 18 months. In these trials, 29% of patients had their dose reduced or suspended secondary to adverse reactions, the majority of which were diarrhea or other GI adverse reactions.



     Other Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions that were reported in at least 1% and less than 2% of IBS-C patients in the LINZESS treatment group and at an incidence greater than in the placebo treatment group are listed below by body system:



   Gastrointestinal Disorders:  gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting



   General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:  fatigue



     Other Adverse Events  



 In placebo-controlled trials in patients with IBS-C, less than 1% LINZESS-treated patients and no placebo-treated patients reported hematochezia; no patient in either treatment group reported melena. Less than 1% of LINZESS-treated and placebo-treated patients reported allergic reactions, urticaria, or hives as adverse events.



     Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC)  



     Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 The data described below reflect exposure to LINZESS in the two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials of 1275 adult patients with CIC (Trials 3 and 4). Patients were randomized to receive placebo or 145 mcg LINZESS or 290 mcg LINZESS once daily on an empty stomach, for at least 12 weeks. Demographic characteristics were comparable between both LINZESS treatment groups and placebo  [see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )]  . Only data for the recommended LINZESS 145 mcg dose and placebo are presented.    Table 2    provides the incidence of adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of CIC patients in the 145 mcg LINZESS treatment group and at an incidence that was greater than in the placebo treatment group.

             Diarrhea  
 

 Diarrhea was the most commonly reported adverse reaction of the LINZESS-treated patients in the pooled CIC placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, 16% of LINZESS-treated patients reported diarrhea compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 2% of the 145 mcg LINZESS-treated patients versus less than 1% of the placebo-treated patients, and 5% of LINZESS-treated patients discontinued due to diarrhea vs less than 1% of placebo-treated patients. The majority of reported cases of diarrhea started within the first 2 weeks of LINZESS treatment. Fecal incontinence was reported in 1% of patients in the LINZESS treatment group, compared with less than 1% in the placebo group. Dehydration was reported in less than 1% of patients in the LINZESS treatment group  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  



 In placebo-controlled trials in patients with CIC, 8% of patients treated with LINZESS and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the 145 mcg LINZESS treatment group, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were diarrhea (5%) and abdominal pain (1%). In comparison, less than 1% of patients in the placebo group withdrew due to diarrhea or abdominal pain.



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Dose Reductions  



 In the open-label, long-term trials, 1129 patients with CIC received 290 mcg of LINZESS daily for up to 18 months. In these trials, 27% of patients had their dose reduced or suspended secondary to adverse reactions, the majority of which were diarrhea or other GI adverse reactions.



     Other Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions that were reported in at least 1% of and less than 2% of CIC patients in the 145 mcg LINZESS treatment group and at an incidence greater than in the placebo treatment group are listed below by body system:

      5.1 Pediatric Risk



     LINZESS is contraindicated in children under 6 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. In neonatal mice, increased fluid secretion as a consequence of GC-C agonism resulted in mortality within the first 24 hours due to dehydration. Due to increased intestinal expression of GC-C, children under 6 years of age may be more likely than older children and adults to develop significant diarrhea and its potentially serious consequences.



    Avoid use of LINZESS in pediatric patients 6 through 17 years of age. Although there were no deaths in older juvenile mice, given the deaths in young juvenile mice and the lack of clinical safety and efficacy data in pediatric patients, avoid the use of LINZESS in pediatric patients 6 through 17 years of age [see Contraindications (  4  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  ) and Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.2  )]  .



    5.2 Diarrhea



  Diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction of LINZESS-treated patients in the pooled IBS-C and CIC double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Severe diarrhea was reported in 2% of the LINZESS-treated patients. The incidence of diarrhea was similar between the IBS-C and CIC populations [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    Instruct patients to stop LINZESS if severe diarrhea occurs and to contact their healthcare provider. The healthcare provider should consider dose suspension and rehydration [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Safety data for OPSUMIT were obtained primarily from one placebo-controlled clinical study in 742 patients with PAH (SERAPHIN study)  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The exposure to OPSUMIT in this trial was up to 3.6 years with a median exposure of about 2 years (N=542 for 1 year; N=429 for 2 years; and N=98 for more than 3 years). The overall incidence of treatment discontinuations because of adverse events was similar across OPSUMIT 10 mg and placebo treatment groups (approximately 11%).

    5.3 Hepatotoxicity



  Other ERAs have caused elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure. The incidence of elevated aminotransferases in the study of OPSUMIT in PAH is shown in Table 1.

         In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT, discontinuations for hepatic adverse events were 3.3% in the OPSUMIT 10 mg group vs. 1.6% for placebo. Obtain liver enzyme tests prior to initiation of OPSUMIT and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated.
 

 Advise patients to report symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, fever, or itching). If clinically relevant aminotransferase elevations occur, or if elevations are accompanied by an increase in bilirubin >2 * ULN, or by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity, discontinue OPSUMIT. Consider re-initiation of OPSUMIT when hepatic enzyme levels normalize in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity.



    5.4 Hemoglobin Decrease



  Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have occurred following administration of other ERAs and were observed in clinical studies with OPSUMIT. These decreases occurred early and stabilized thereafter. In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT in PAH, OPSUMIT 10 mg caused a mean decrease in hemoglobin from baseline to up to 18 months of about 1.0 g/dL compared to no change in the placebo group. A decrease in hemoglobin to below 10.0 g/dL was reported in 8.7% of the OPSUMIT 10 mg group and in 3.4% of the placebo group. Decreases in hemoglobin seldom require transfusion. Initiation of OPSUMIT is not recommended in patients with severe anemia. Measure hemoglobin prior to initiation of treatment and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.5 Pulmonary Edema with Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease (PVOD)



  Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. If confirmed, discontinue OPSUMIT.



    5.6 Decreased Sperm Counts



  Other ERAs have caused adverse effects on spermatogenesis. Counsel men about potential effects on fertility [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  .

  6.1 Clinical Study Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In 5 controlled randomized clinical trials, Asclera has been administered to 401 patients with small or very small varicose veins (reticular and spider veins) and compared with another sclerosing agent and with placebo. Patients were 18 to 70 years old. The patient population was predominately female and consisted of Caucasian and Asian patients.



 Table 1 shows adverse events more common with Asclera or sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) 1% than with placebo by at least 3% in the placebo- controlled EASI study  (see  Clinical Studies [14]  )  . All of these were injection site reactions and most were mild.

   6.2 Post-marketing Safety Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been reported during use of polidocanol in world-wide experience; in some of these cases these adverse events have been serious or troublesome. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and without a control group, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

ASCLERA,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Do not inject intra-arterially. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Do not inject intra-perivascularily. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Anaphylaxis



   Severe allergic reactions have been reported following polidocanol use, including anaphylactic reactions, some of them fatal. Severe reactions are more frequent with use of larger volumes (> 3 mL). The dose of polidocanol should therefore be minimized. Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately.  



 Severe adverse local effects, including tissue necrosis, may occur following extravasation; therefore, care should be taken in intravenous needle placement and the smallest effective volume at each injection site should be used.



 After the injection session is completed, apply compression with a stocking or bandage, and have the patient walk for 15-20 minutes. Keep the patient under supervision during this period to treat any anaphylactic or allergic reaction (see  Dosage and Administration [2]  )  .



    5.2 Accidental Intra-arterial Injection



  Intra-arterial injection can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene. If this occurs consult a vascular surgeon immediately.



    5.3 Inadvertent Perivascular Injection



  Inadvertent perivascular injection of Asclera can cause pain. If pain is severe, a local anesthetic (without adrenaline) may be injected.

  6.1 Clinical Trials

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients in clinical practice.



 Safety data are based on pooled results from four Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with a total of 390 patients of which 261 patients received weekly subcutaneous injections of 200 mg of KYNAMRO and 129 patients received placebo for a median treatment duration of 25 weeks (age range 12-81 years, 47% women, 84% Caucasian, 10% Blacks, 3% Asian, 3% other).  For the 141 participants who subsequently were treated in the open-label extension trial, the mean length of study treatment, including exposure to KYNAMRO in the index study, was 19.8 months and the median was 18.2 months. A total of 41 individuals with HoFH were exposed to KYNAMRO for at least 6 months and 25 were exposed for at least 12 months.



 Eighteen percent of patients on KYNAMRO and 2% of patients on placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with KYNAMRO that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: injection site reactions (5.0%), alanine aminotransferase increased (3.4%), flu-like symptoms (2.7%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (2.3%), and liver function test abnormal (1.5%).



     Common Adverse Reactions    



   Table 2  enumerates adverse reactions that occurred among pooled Phase 3 patients treated with KYNAMRO at an incidence that was at least 2% more than that observed in the placebo-treated patients, listed by system organ class and frequency (MedDRA v.13.0).  Similar types and severities of adverse reactions were observed across all populations in this pooled table including the subset of patients with HoFH.

 In the phase 3 trial in patients with HoFH, the mean change in platelet count from baseline to Week 28/Early Termination was -30.6 * 10  3  /uL in the mipomersen group and +8.1 * 10  3  /uL in the placebo group. In the pooled Phase 3 trials the mean change in platelet count from baseline to Week 28/Early Termination was -23.8 * 10  3  /uL in the mipomersen group and -3.5 * 10  3  /uL in the placebo group.



     Transaminase Elevations    



 In the pooled, placebo-controlled clinical trials with KYNAMRO, elevated serum transaminase levels, mainly ALT, have been observed as presented in  Table 3  .  Elevated ALT levels >= 3x ULN have been reported on two consecutive occasions at least 7 days apart in 8.4% of patients receiving KYNAMRO therapy (versus 0% of placebo patients) with 16.5% of patients receiving KYNAMRO therapy having at least 1 result that was >= 3x ULN (versus 0.8% for placebo patients).  The ALT elevations observed in the pooled, placebo-controlled trials were generally accompanied by lesser AST elevations and were not associated with increased total bilirubin, changes in INR or PTT, nor by decreased albumin levels.  After stopping therapy, in the patients in whom an elevation was observed, transaminase elevations trended toward baseline over a period of weeks to months.

     Hepatic Steatosis    



 Increases in liver fat as measured by MRI were greater in patients receiving KYNAMRO therapy than in patients receiving placebo.  Data from Phase 3 supportive trials in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease and in patients with high risk hypercholesterolemia demonstrated after 26 weeks of treatment, a median nominal increase in fat fraction of 9.6% relative to baseline following KYNAMRO therapy versus a nominal 0.02% change in the placebo group (mean increases were 12.2% mipomersen vs 0.4% placebo).  The maximum change in fat fraction was 46% for the KYNAMRO group and 28% for the placebo group. Sixty-two percent of patients receiving KYNAMRO developed a 5% or greater increase in hepatic fat versus 8% of patients receiving placebo. In general, these elevations in fat fraction decreased when assessed by MRI performed 24 weeks after cessation of KYNAMRO in the Phase 3 trial of patients with high-risk hypercholesterolemia. In the open-label extension trial, among individuals with a measurement at baseline and at 12 months or longer on KYNAMRO, 25% had an average liver fat fraction > 20% on at least one occasion.  



     Injection Site Reactions    



 The most commonly-reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions occurring in 84% of patients receiving KYNAMRO versus 33% of placebo treated patients.  The most common injection site reactions were erythema (59%), pain (56%), hematoma (32%), pruritus (29%), swelling (18%) and discoloration (17%).  Injection site reactions did not occur with every injection.  Injection site reactions resulted in discontinuation of KYNAMRO in 5% of patients. Recall reactions, consisting of local erythema, tenderness and/or pruritus at previous injection sites when subsequent injections were administered, were observed in 8% of patients, all of whom were receiving KYNAMRO.  



     Flu-like Symptoms    



 Flu-like symptoms, defined as any one of the following: influenza-like illness, pyrexia, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise or fatigue and occurring within 2 days of injection, have been reported more frequently in patients receiving KYNAMRO (29.9%) versus placebo (16.3%) in the pooled Phase 3 studies. Flu-like symptoms did not occur with all injections.  Flu-like symptoms resulted in discontinuation of KYNAMRO in 2.7% of patients. In the open-label extension trial, in which all patients received KYNAMRO therapy, 66% reported flu-like symptoms, 25% discontinued treatment due to flu-like symptoms and 9% experienced severe flu-like symptoms.



     Immunogenicity    



 In the pooled Phase 3 trials, 38% of KYNAMRO-treated patients tested positive for anti-KYNAMRO antibodies during the 6-month trials. Efficacy results in the Phase 3 trials in patients who tested positive for anti-KYNAMRO antibodies were similar to patients who remained negative for antibodies (mean LDL-C percent change from baseline was -32% for antibody-positive and -34% for antibody-negative participants).  In the open-label extension trial, approximately 72% of patients receiving KYNAMRO therapy tested positive for anti-KYNAMRO antibodies (35% with titers >3200). The incidence of flu-like symptoms and the incidence of discontinuation of KYNAMRO were higher in antibody-positive patients.  Antibodies to KYNAMRO were associated with higher trough levels for the drug. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to KYNAMRO with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of KYNAMRO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY

  WARNING: RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY

      KYNAMRO can cause elevations in transaminases. In the KYNAMRO clinical trial in patients with HoFH, 4 (12%) of the 34 patients treated with KYNAMRO compared with 0% of the 17 patients treated with placebo had at least one elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >= 3x upper limit of normal (ULN). There were no concomitant clinically meaningful elevations of total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) [see   Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )  ].     



     KYNAMRO also increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. In the trials in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and hyperlipidemia, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 10% after 26 weeks of treatment, from 0% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for advanced liver disease; including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis [see   Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )  ].      



     Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment and then ALT, AST regularly as recommended. During treatment, withhold the dose of KYNAMRO if the ALT or AST are >= 3x ULN. Discontinue KYNAMRO for clinically significant liver toxicity [see   Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )  ].     



     Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, KYNAMRO is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the KYNAMRO REMS [see   Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ]  .

 *  Flu-like symptoms, which typically occur within 2 days after an injection, occur in 30% of patients and include one or more of the following: influenza-like illness, pyrexia, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise or fatigue (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Hepatotoxicity



  KYNAMRO can cause elevations in transaminases and hepatic steatosis, as described below. To what extent KYNAMRO-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the elevations in transaminases is unknown. There is concern that KYNAMRO could induce steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of KYNAMRO in HoFH would have been unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size and duration [see  Clinical Studies (  14  )    ].



  



   Elevation of Transaminases    



 KYNAMRO can cause increases in serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]).  In the clinical trial, 4 (12%) of the 34 subjects with HoFH treated with KYNAMRO compared to 0% of the 17 subjects treated with placebo had an elevation in ALT >= 3x ULN, and 3 (9%) of those treated with KYNAMRO compared to 0% treated with placebo had at least one elevation in ALT >= 5x ULN.



 Measure a full liver panel to include ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase before initiation of treatment with KYNAMRO [see  Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )    ]. KYNAMRO is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, or active liver disease, including unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. If the baseline liver-related tests are abnormal, consider initiating KYNAMRO after an appropriate work-up and the baseline abnormalities are explained or resolved. During the first year, conduct liver-related tests monthly (ALT and AST, at a minimum). After the first year, conduct these tests at least every 3 months. Discontinue KYNAMRO for persistent or clinically significant elevations [see  Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )    ].



 If transaminase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, lethargy, flu-like symptoms), increases in bilirubin >= 2x ULN, or active liver disease, discontinue treatment with KYNAMRO and identify the probable cause.



   Hepatic Steatosis    



 KYNAMRO increases hepatic fat (steatosis) with or without concomitant increases in transaminases [see  Adverse Reactions    (  6.1  )]. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for advanced liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. The long-term consequences of hepatic steatosis associated with KYNAMRO therapy are unknown. During the clinical trials in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and hyperlipidemia, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 10% after 26 weeks of treatment, from 0% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 



 Alcohol may increase levels of hepatic fat and induce or exacerbate liver injury. It is recommended that patients taking KYNAMRO should consume no more than one alcoholic drink per day.



 Caution should be exercised when KYNAMRO is used with other medications known to have potential for hepatotoxicity, for example isotretinoin, amiodarone, acetaminophen (>4 g/day for >= 3 days/week), methotrexate, tetracyclines, and tamoxifen. The effect of concomitant administration of KYNAMRO with other hepatotoxic medications is unknown. More frequent monitoring of liver-related tests may be warranted.



 Mipomersen has not been studied concomitantly with other LDL-lowering agents that can also increase hepatic fat. Therefore, the combined use of such agents is not recommended.



    5.2 KYNAMRO REMS



  Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, KYNAMRO is available only through a limited program under the REMS. Under the KYNAMRO REMS, only certified healthcare providers and pharmacies may prescribe and distribute KYNAMRO. Further information is available at  www.KynamroREMS.com    or by telephone at 1-877-KYNAMRO (1-877-596-2676).



    5.3 Injection Site Reactions



  Injection site reactions have been reported in 84% of patients receiving KYNAMRO therapy.  These local reactions typically consist of one or more of the following: erythema, pain, tenderness, pruritus and local swelling. Injection site reactions do not occur with all injections but resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 5% of patients in pooled Phase 3 trials.  [see  Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )    ]  To minimize the potential for injection site reactions, proper technique for subcutaneous administration should be followed.  [see  Patient Counseling Information (  17  )    ]



    5.4 Flu-Like Symptoms



  Flu-like symptoms have been reported in 30% of patients receiving KYNAMRO therapy and include one or more of the following: influenza-like illness, pyrexia, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise or fatigue. Flu-like symptoms, which typically occur within 2 days after an injection, do not occur with all injections but resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 3% of patients in pooled Phase 3 trials.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 During clinical development for the approved indications, 16326 patients were exposed to XARELTO. These included 7111 patients who received XARELTO 15 mg or 20 mg orally once daily for a mean of 19 months (5558 for 12 months and 2512 for 24 months) to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (ROCKET AF); 4728 patients who received either XARELTO 15 mg orally twice daily for three weeks followed by 20 mg orally once daily (EINSTEIN DVT, EINSTEIN PE) or 20 mg orally once daily (EINSTEIN Extension) to treat DVT, PE, and to reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and of PE; and 4487 patients who received XARELTO 10 mg orally once daily for prophylaxis of DVT following hip or knee replacement surgery (RECORD 1-3).



   Hemorrhage



 The most common adverse reactions with XARELTO were bleeding complications  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .



       Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation    



 In the ROCKET AF trial, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent drug discontinuation were bleeding events, with incidence rates of 4.3% for XARELTO vs. 3.1% for warfarin. The incidence of discontinuations for non-bleeding adverse events was similar in both treatment groups.



 Table 1 shows the number of patients experiencing various types of bleeding events in the ROCKET AF trial.

           EINSTEIN Extension Study
 

 In the EINSTEIN Extension clinical study, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent drug discontinuation were bleeding events, with incidence rates of 1.8% for XARELTO vs. 0.2% for placebo treatment groups. The mean duration of treatment was 190 days for both XARELTO and placebo treatment groups.



 Table 3 shows the number of patients experiencing bleeding events in the EINSTEIN Extension study.

    WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF XARELTO INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS,    (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA  

    *   A. PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF XARELTO INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS 
      Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant   [see   Dosage and Administration (2.2  ,   2.6  ),   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  , and   Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .  
 

   B.   SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA  



   Epidural or spinal hematomas have occurred in patients treated with XARELTO who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:  



 *  use of indwelling epidural catheters 
 *  concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants 
 *  a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures 
 *  a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery 
 *  optimal timing between the administration of XARELTO and neuraxial procedures is not known 
        [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2  ,   5.3)   and   Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].    
 

   Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .  



   Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .  



    EXCERPT:    *   WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF XARELTO INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, and (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA 
      See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning  
 

   (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF XARELTO INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS  



   Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, increases the risk of thrombotic events. To reduce this risk, consider coverage with another anticoagulant if XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy (  2.2  ,   2.6  ,   5.1  ,   14.1  ).  



   (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA  



   Epidural or spinal hematomas have occurred in patients treated with XARELTO who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis (  5.2  ,   5.3  ,   6.2  ).  



   Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment and if observed, treat urgently. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients who are or who need to be anticoagulated (  5.3  ).

   EXCERPT:    *    Risk of bleeding: XARELTO can cause serious and fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Pregnancy-related hemorrhage: Use XARELTO with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for obstetric hemorrhage and/or emergent delivery. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss. (  5.7  ) 
 *    Prosthetic heart valves: XARELTO use not recommended (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation



  Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from XARELTO to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2  ,  2.6  ) and  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .



    5.2 Risk of Bleeding



  XARELTO increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious or fatal bleeding. In deciding whether to prescribe XARELTO to patients at increased risk of bleeding, the risk of thrombotic events should be weighed against the risk of bleeding.



 Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss and consider the need for blood replacement. Discontinue XARELTO in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years.



 Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin, P2Y12platelet inhibitors, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  



 Concomitant use of drugs that are combined P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole and ritonavir) increases rivaroxaban exposure and may increase bleeding risk [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .



    Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect:  



 A specific antidote for rivaroxaban is not available. Because of high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialyzable [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. Partial reversal of prothrombin time prolongation has been seen after administration of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) in healthy volunteers. The use of other procoagulant reversal agents like activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has not been evaluated.



    5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture



  When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis [see  Boxed Warning  ]  .



  To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban [see       Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)   ]     . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.  



 An epidural catheter should not be removed earlier than 18 hours after the last administration of XARELTO. The next XARELTO dose is not to be administered earlier than 6 hours after the removal of the catheter. If traumatic puncture occurs, the administration of XARELTO is to be delayed for 24 hours.



  Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.  



    5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment



  Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation



 Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min since drug exposure is increased. Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in situations in which renal function may decline) and adjust therapy accordingly .  Discontinue XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on XARELTO [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ].  



   Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and of PE



 Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min due to an expected increase in rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects in this patient population [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ]  .



   Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery



 Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min due to an expected increase in rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects in this patient population. Observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min. Patients who develop acute renal failure while on XARELTO should discontinue the treatment [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ].  



    5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment



  No clinical data are available for patients with severe hepatic impairment.



 Avoid use of XARELTO in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment or with any hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy since drug exposure and bleeding risk may be increased [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.8)  ]  .



    5.6 Use with P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers



  Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and conivaptan) [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .



 Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort) [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



    5.7 Risk of Pregnancy-Related Hemorrhage



  In pregnant women, XARELTO should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. XARELTO dosing in pregnancy has not been studied. The anticoagulant effect of XARELTO cannot be monitored with standard laboratory testing nor readily reversed. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms suggesting blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, hypotension, or fetal distress).



    5.8 Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves



  The safety and efficacy of XARELTO have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Therefore, use of XARELTO is not recommended in these patients.



    5.9 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients Who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy



  Initiation of XARELTO is not recommended acutely as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary embolism who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.

  6.1. Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer were treated with CAPRELSA 300 mg (n=231) or Placebo (n=99). The population exposed to CAPRELSA was 58% male, 94% white, and had a median age of 50 years. The data described below reflect a median exposure to CAPRELSA for 607 days.



 The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions which occurred in >20% of CAPRELSA-treated patients and with a between-arm difference of >=5% included, in order of decreasing frequency: diarrhea/colitis, rash, acneiform dermatitis, hypertension, nausea, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain.



 Among CAPRELSA-treated patients, dose interruption occurred in 109 (47%) and dose reduction occurred in 83 (36%). Adverse reactions led to study treatment discontinuation in 28 of 231 patients (12%) receiving CAPRELSA and in 3 of 99 patients (3.0%) receiving placebo. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in 2 or more (>=0.9%) patients treated with CAPRELSA were: asthenia (1.7%), rash (1.7%), diarrhea (0.9%), fatigue (0.9%), pyrexia (0.9%), elevated creatinine (0.9%), QT prolongation (0.9%), and hypertension (0.9%).

           Clinically important uncommon adverse drug reactions in patients who received CAPRELSA versus patients who received placebo included pancreatitis (0.4% vs. 0%) and heart failure (0.9% vs. 0%).
 

 Blurred vision was more common in patients who received CAPRELSA versus patients who received placebo for medullary thyroid cancer (9% vs. 1%, respectively). Scheduled slit lamp examinations revealed corneal opacities (vortex keratopathies) in treated patients, which can lead to halos and decreased visual acuity. Perform ophthalmologic examination, including slit lamp examination, in patients who report visual changes.



   Class effects  



 CAPRELSA is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) signaling. Inhibition of VEGFR signaling can result in intestinal perforation. Intestinal perforation occurred in 0.4% of CAPRELSA treated patients versus 0% of placebo treated patients.



 The incidence of Grade 1-2 bleeding events was 14% in patients receiving CAPRELSA compared with 7% on placebo in the randomized portion of the medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) study.

   5.1 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes



  CAPRELSA can prolong the QT interval in a concentration-dependent manner [see   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ]. Torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and sudden deaths have occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA.



 Do not start CAPRELSA treatment in patients whose QTcF interval is greater than 450 ms. Do not administer CAPRELSA to patients who have a history of Torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure. CAPRELSA has not been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or recent myocardial infarction. Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and monitor QT interval frequently.



 Obtain an ECG and serum potassium, calcium, magnesium and TSH at baseline, 2-4 weeks and 8-12 weeks after starting treatment with CAPRELSA, and every 3 months thereafter. Monitor electrolytes and ECGs more frequently in patients who experience diarrhea. Following any dose reduction for QT prolongation or any dose interruption greater than 2 weeks, conduct QT assessments as described above. Maintain serum potassium levels of 4 mEq/L or higher (within normal range) and maintain serum magnesium and calcium levels within normal ranges to reduce the risk of QT prolongation.



 Avoid using CAPRELSA with drugs known to prolong the QT interval [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.11)    and   Drug Interactions (7.4)    ]. If such drugs are given to patients already receiving CAPRELSA and no alternative therapy exists, perform ECG monitoring of the QT interval more frequently.



 Stop CAPRELSA in patients who develop a QTcF greater than 500 ms until the QTcF returns to less than 450 ms. Dosing of CAPRELSA can then be resumed at a reduced dose [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].



    5.2 Skin Reactions and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome



  Severe skin reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), some leading to death, have occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider permanent discontinuation of CAPRELSA for severe skin reactions [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].



 Photosensitivity reactions can occur during CAPRELSA treatment and up to 4 months after treatment discontinuation.



    5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease



  Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or pneumonitis, including fatalities, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider a diagnosis of ILD in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms.



 Interrupt CAPRELSA for acute or worsening pulmonary symptoms. Discontinue CAPRELSA if ILD is confirmed.



    5.4 Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events



  Ischemic cerebrovascular events, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. In the randomized medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) study, ischemic cerebrovascular events occurred more frequently with CAPRELSA compared to placebo (1.3% compared to 0%). The safety of resumption of CAPRELSA therapy after resolution of an ischemic cerebrovascular event has not been studied. Discontinue CAPRELSA in patients who experience a severe ischemic cerebrovascular event.



    5.5 Hemorrhage



  Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Do not administer CAPRELSA to patients with a recent history of hemoptysis of >=1/2 teaspoon of red blood. Discontinue CAPRELSA in patients with severe hemorrhage.



    5.6 Heart Failure



  Heart failure, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Consider discontinuation of CAPRELSA in patients with heart failure. Heart failure may not be reversible upon stopping CAPRELSA.



    5.7 Diarrhea



  Diarrhea of Grade 3 or greater severity occurred in 11% of patients receiving CAPRELSA in the randomized MTC study. If diarrhea occurs, carefully monitor serum electrolytes and ECGs to reduce the risk and enable early detection of QT prolongation resulting from dehydration [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]. Interrupt CAPRELSA for severe diarrhea. Upon improvement, resume CAPRELSA at a reduced dose [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].



    5.8 Hypothyroidism



  In the randomized MTC study in which 90% of the patients enrolled had prior thyroidectomy, increased dosing of thyroid replacement therapy was required in 49% of CAPRELSA-treated patients compared to 17% of placebo-treated patients. Obtain Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at baseline, at 2 - 4 weeks and 8 - 12 weeks after starting treatment with CAPRELSA, and every 3 months thereafter. If signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism occur, examine thyroid hormone levels and adjust thyroid replacement therapy accordingly..



    5.9 Hypertension



  Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Monitor all patients for hypertension. Dose reduction or interruption for hypertension may be necessary. If hypertension cannot be controlled, do not resume CAPRELSA [see   Dosage and Administration, (2.1)    ].



    5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome



  Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by an MRI of the brain, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider this syndrome in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. In clinical studies, three of four patients who developed RPLS while taking CAPRELSA also had hypertension. Discontinue CAPRELSA treatment in patients with RPLS.



    5.11 Drug Interactions



  Avoid administration of CAPRELSA with anti-arrhythmic drugs (including but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, sotalol, dofetilide) and other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to chloroquine, clarithromycin, dolasetron, granisetron, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, and pimozide) [see   Drug Interactions (7.4)    and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ].



    5.12 Renal Impairment



  Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and monitor the QT interval closely. There is no information available for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see   Boxed Warning    ,   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ,   Use in Specific Populations (8.6)    and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)    ].



    5.13 Hepatic Impairment



  CAPRELSA is not recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, as safety and efficacy have not been established [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].



    5.14 Embryofetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, CAPRELSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In nonclinical studies in rats, vandetanib was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic at exposures equivalent to or lower than those expected at the recommended human dose of 300 mg/day and had adverse effects on female fertility, embryofetal development, and postnatal development of pups.



 If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy. Advise women of childbearing potential that they must use effective contraception during CAPRELSA treatment and for at least four months following the last dose of CAPRELSA [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.8  )  ].



    5.15 CAPRELSA REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In clinical trials, KADCYLA has been evaluated as single-agent in 884 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The most common (frequency >= 25%) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) seen in 884 patients treated with KADCYLA were fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, headache, increased transaminases, constipation and epistaxis.



 The ADRs described in  Table 6  were identified in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in a randomized trial (Study 1)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Patients were randomized to receive KADCYLA or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The median duration of study treatment was 7.6 months for patients in the KADCYLA-treated group and 5.5 months and 5.3 months for patients treated with lapatinib and capecitabine, respectively. Two hundred and eleven (43.1%) patients experienced >= Grade 3 adverse events in the KADCYLA-treated group compared with 289 (59.2%) patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. Dose adjustments for KADCYLA were permitted  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Thirty-two patients (6.5%) discontinued KADCYLA due to an adverse event, compared with 41 patients (8.4%) who discontinued lapatinib, and 51 patients (10.5%) who discontinued capecitabine due to an adverse event. The most common adverse events leading to KADCYLA withdrawal were thrombocytopenia and increased transaminases. Eighty patients (16.3%) treated with KADCYLA had adverse events leading to dose reductions. The most frequent adverse events leading to dose reduction of KADCYLA (in >= 1% of patients) included thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, and peripheral neuropathy. Adverse events that led to dose delays occurred in 116 (23.7%) of KADCYLA treated patients. The most frequent adverse events leading to a dose delay of KADCYLA (in >= 1% of patients) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, fatigue, increased transaminases and pyrexia.



   Table 6  reports the ADRs that occurred in patients in the KADCYLA-treated group (n=490) of the randomized trial (Study 1). Selected laboratory abnormalities are shown in  Table 7  . The most common ADRs seen with KADCYLA in the randomized trial (frequency > 25%) were nausea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, headache, and constipation. The most common NCI-CTCAE (version 3) >= Grade 3 ADRs (frequency >2%) were thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, anemia, hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and fatigue.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for an immune response to KADCYLA.



 A total of 836 patients from six clinical studies were tested at multiple time points for anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA) responses to KADCYLA. Following KADCYLA dosing, 5.3% (44/836) of patients tested positive for anti-KADCYLA antibodies at one or more post-dose time points. The presence of KADCYLA in patient serum at the time of ATA sampling may interfere with the ability of this assay to detect anti-KADCYLA antibodies. As a result, data may not accurately reflect the true incidence of anti-KADCYLA antibody development. In addition, neutralizing activity of anti-KADCYLA antibodies has not been assessed.



 Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods used. Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive result in a test method may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, drug interference, concomitant medication and the underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to KADCYLA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Clinical significance of anti-KADCYLA antibodies is not yet known.

   5.1 Hepatotoxicity



  Hepatotoxicity, predominantly in the form of asymptomatic, transient increases in the concentrations of serum transaminases, has been observed in clinical trials with KADCYLA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Serious hepatobiliary disorders, including at least two fatal cases of severe drug-induced liver injury and associated hepatic encephalopathy, have been reported in clinical trials with KADCYLA. Some of the observed cases may have been confounded by comorbidities and/or concomitant medications with known hepatotoxic potential.



 Monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin prior to initiation of KADCYLA treatment and prior to each KADCYLA dose. Patients with known active hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus were excluded from Study 1 [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Reduce the dose or discontinue KADCYLA as appropriate in cases of increased serum transaminases and/or total bilirubin [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Permanently discontinue KADCYLA treatment in patients with serum transaminases > 3 * ULN and concomitant total bilirubin > 2 * ULN. KADCYLA has not been studied in patients with serum transaminases > 2.5 * ULN or bilirubin > 1.5 * ULN prior to the initiation of treatment.



  In clinical trials of KADCYLA, cases of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver have been identified from liver biopsies (3 cases out of 884 treated patients, one of which was fatal). Two of these three cases of NRH were observed in the randomized trial (Study 1) [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . NRH is a rare liver condition characterized by widespread benign transformation of hepatic parenchyma into small regenerative nodules; NRH may lead to non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The diagnosis of NRH can be confirmed only by histopathology. NRH should be considered in all patients with clinical symptoms of portal hypertension and/or cirrhosis-like pattern seen on the computed tomography (CT) scan of the liver but with normal transaminases and no other manifestations of cirrhosis. Upon diagnosis of NRH, KADCYLA treatment must be permanently discontinued.  



    5.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction



  Patients treated with KADCYLA are at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. A decrease of LVEF to < 40% has been observed in patients treated with KADCYLA. In the randomized trial (Study 1), left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.8% of patients in the KADCYLA-treated group and 3.3% of patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Assess LVEF prior to initiation of KADCYLA and at regular intervals (e.g. every three months) during treatment to ensure the LVEF is within the institution's normal limits. Treatment with KADCYLA has not been studied in patients with LVEF < 50% prior to initiation of treatment. If, at routine monitoring, LVEF is < 40%, or is 40% to 45% with a 10% or greater absolute decrease below the pretreatment value, withhold KADCYLA and repeat LVEF assessment within approximately 3 weeks. Permanently discontinue KADCYLA if the LVEF has not improved or has declined further [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Patients with a history of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), serious cardiac arrhythmia, or history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months were excluded from Study 1 [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .



    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  KADCYLA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of KADCYLA in pregnant women and no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have been conducted with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Nevertheless, treatment with trastuzumab, the antibody component of KADCYLA, during pregnancy in the postmarketing setting has resulted in oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. DM1, the cytotoxic component of KADCYLA, can be expected to cause embryo-fetal toxicity based on its mechanism of action.



  If KADCYLA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving KADCYLA or within 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .  



  Verify pregnancy status prior to the initiation of KADCYLA. Advise patients of the risks of embryo-fetal death and birth defects and the need for contraception during and after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they suspect they may be pregnant. If KADCYLA is administered during pregnancy or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving KADCYLA or within 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA, immediately report exposure to the Genentech Adverse Event Line at 1-888-835-2555. Encourage women who may be exposed during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception, to enroll in the MotHER Pregnancy Registry by contacting 1-800-690-6720 [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .  



    5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity



  Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, some leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or fatal outcome have been reported in clinical trials with KADCYLA. Pneumonitis at an incidence of 0.8% (7 out of 884 treated patients) has been reported, with one case of grade 3 pneumonitis. Signs and symptoms include dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and pulmonary infiltrates. These events may or may not occur as sequelae of infusion reactions. In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of pneumonitis was 1.2% [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Permanently discontinue treatment with KADCYLA in patients diagnosed with ILD or pneumonitis.



 Patients with dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and co-morbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary toxicity.



    5.5 Infusion-Related Reactions, Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Treatment with KADCYLA has not been studied in patients who had trastuzumab permanently discontinued due to infusion-related reactions (IRR) and/or hypersensitivity; treatment with KADCYLA is not recommended for these patients.



 Infusion-related reactions, characterized by one or more of the following symptoms - flushing, chills, pyrexia, dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, and tachycardia have been reported in clinical trials of KADCYLA. In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of IRRs in patients treated with KADCYLA was 1.4% [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . In most patients, these reactions resolved over the course of several hours to a day after the infusion was terminated. KADCYLA treatment should be interrupted in patients with severe IRR. KADCYLA treatment should be permanently discontinued in the event of a life-threatening IRR [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Patients should be observed closely for IRR reactions, especially during the first infusion.



 One case of a serious, allergic/anaphylactic-like reaction has been observed in clinical trials of single-agent KADCYLA. Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use.



    5.6 Hemorrhage



   Cases of hemorrhagic events, including central nervous system, respiratory, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, have been reported in clinical trials with Kadcyla. Some of these bleeding events resulted in fatal outcomes. In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of hemorrhage was 32.2% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 16.4% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. The incidence of >= Grade 3 hemorrhage was 1.8% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.8% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Although, in some of the observed cases the patients were also receiving anti-coagulation therapy, antiplatelet therapy, or had thrombocytopenia, in others there were no known additional risk factors. Use caution with these agents and consider additional monitoring when concomitant use is medically necessary.  



    5.7 Thrombocytopenia



  Thrombocytopenia, or decreased platelet count, was reported in clinical trials of KADCYLA (103 of 884 treated patients with >= Grade 3; 283 of 884 treated patients with any Grade). The majority of these patients had Grade 1 or 2 events (< LLN to >= 50,000/mm  3  ) with the nadir occurring by day 8 and generally improving to Grade 0 or 1 (>= 75,000 /mm  3  ) by the next scheduled dose. In clinical trials of KADCYLA, the incidence and severity of thrombocytopenia were higher in Asian patients.



 In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of thrombocytopenia was 31.2% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 3.3% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The incidence of >= Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 14.5% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.4% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. In Asian patients, the incidence of >= Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 45.1% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 1.3% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group.



 Monitor platelet counts prior to initiation of KADCYLA and prior to each KADCYLA dose [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . KADCYLA has not been studied in patients with platelet counts <100,000/mm  3  prior to initiation of treatment. In the event of decreased platelet count to Grade 3 or greater (< 50,000/mm  3  ) do not administer KADCYLA until platelet counts recover to Grade 1 (>= 75,000/mm  3  ) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Patients with thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/mm  3  ) and patients on anti-coagulant treatment should be closely monitored during treatment with KADCYLA.



    5.8 Neurotoxicity



  Peripheral neuropathy, mainly as Grade 1 and predominantly sensory, was reported in clinical trials of KADCYLA (14 of 884 treated patients with >= Grade 3; 196 of 884 treated patients with any Grade). In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of peripheral neuropathy was 21.2% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 13.5% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The incidence of >= Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 2.2% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.2% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group.



 KADCYLA should be temporarily discontinued in patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until resolution to <= Grade 2. Patients should be clinically monitored on an ongoing basis for signs or symptoms of neurotoxicity [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)  ]  .



    5.9 HER2 Testing



  Detection of HER2 protein overexpression or gene amplification is necessary for selection of patients appropriate for KADCYLA therapy because these are the only patients studied for whom benefit has been shown [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ,  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . In the randomized study (Study 1), patients with breast cancer were required to have evidence of HER2 overexpression defined as 3+ IHC by Dako HerceptestTM or evidence of overexpression defined as FISH amplification ratio >= 2.0 by Dako HER2  FISH PharmDxTM test kit. Only limited data were available for patients whose breast cancer was positive by FISH and 0 or 1+ by IHC.



 Assessment of HER2 status should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the specific technology being utilized. Improper assay performance, including use of sub- optimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results.



    5.10 Extravasation



  In KADCYLA clinical studies, reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed. These reactions, observed more frequently within 24 hours of infusion, were usually mild and comprised erythema, tenderness, skin irritation, pain, or swelling at the infusion site. Specific treatment for KADCYLA extravasation is unknown. The infusion site should be closely monitored for possible subcutaneous infiltration during drug administration.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   Opioid-Induced Constipation in Adult Patients with Chronic Non-Cancer Pain  



 The safety of RELISTOR was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with opioid-induced constipation and chronic non-cancer pain receiving opioid analgesia. This study (Study 1) included a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period in which adult patients were randomized to receive RELISTOR 12 mg once daily (150 patients) or placebo (162 patients) [  see    Clinical Studies (    14.1        )  ]. After 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients began an 8-week open-label treatment period during which RELISTOR 12 mg was administered less frequently than the recommended dosage regimen of 12 mg once daily.



 Adverse reactions in adult patients with opioid-induced constipation and chronic non-cancer pain receiving RELISTOR are shown in Table 2. The adverse reactions in the table below may reflect symptoms of opioid withdrawal.




  Table 2:  Adverse Reactions* in 4-Week Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Period of Clinical Study of RELISTOR in Adult Patients with Opioid-InducedConstipation and Chronic Non-Cancer Pain

  *Adverse reactions occuring in >= 1% of patients receiving RELISTOR 12 mg once daily and at an incidence greater than placebo.   
         .
 

 During the 4-week double-blind period, in patients with opioid-induced constipation and chronic non-cancer pain that received RELISTOR 12 mg every other day, there was a higher incidence of adverse reactions, including nausea (12%), diarrhea (12%), vomiting (7%), tremor (3%), feeling of body temperature change (3%), piloerection (3%), and chills (2%) as compared to daily Relistor dosing.  Use of RELISTOR 12 mg every other day is not recommended in patients with OIC and chronic non-cancer pain  [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  . The rates of discontinuation due to adverse reactions during the double-blind period (Study 1) were higher in the RELISTOR once daily (7%) than the placebo group (3%).  Abdominal pain was the most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation from the double-blind period in the RELISTOR once daily group (2%).



 The safety of RELISTOR was also evaluated in a 48-week, open-label, uncontrolled trial in 1034 adult patients with opioid-induced constipation and chronic non-cancer pain (Study 2). Patients were allowed to administer RELISTOR 12 mg less frequently than the recommended dosage regimen of 12 mg once daily, and took a median of 6 doses per week. A total of 624 patients (60%) completed at least 24 weeks of treatment and 477 (46%) completed the 48-week study. The adverse reactions seen in this study were similar to those observed during the 4-week double-blind period of Study 1. Additionally, in Study 2, investigators reported 4 myocardial infarctions (1 fatal), 1 stroke (fatal), 1 fatal cardiac arrest and 1 sudden death. It is not possible to establish a relationship between these events and RELISTOR.



   Opioid-Induced Constipation in Adult Patients with Advanced Illness  



 The safety of RELISTOR was evaluated in two, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with opioid-induced constipation and advanced illness receiving palliative care: Study 3 included a single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled period, whereas Study 4 included a 14-day multiple dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled period [see  Clinical Studies (    14        .2        )  ]. 



 The most common (>= 5%) adverse reactions in adult patients with opioid-induced constipation and advanced illness receiving RELISTOR are shown in Table 3 below.

         The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events during the double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials (Study 3 and Study 4) were comparable between RELISTOR (1%) and placebo (2%).
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of RELISTOR. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   EXCERPT:    *   Gastrointestinal perforation : Consider the overall risk benefit in patients with known or suspected lesions of the GI tract. Monitor for severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue if development of symptoms (  5.1  ) 
 *   Severe or persistent diarrhea : Discontinue if severe or persistent diarrhea occurs during treatment (  5.2  ) 
 *   Opioid withdrawal : Consider the overall risk benefit in patients with disruptions to the blood-brain barrier. Monitor closely for symptoms of opioid withdrawal (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Gastrointestinal Perforation



   Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in adult patients with opioid-induced constipation and advanced illness with conditions that may be associated with localized or diffuse reduction of structural integrity in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., peptic ulcer disease, Ogilvie's syndrome, diverticular disease, infiltrative gastrointestinal tract malignancies or peritoneal metastases). Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using RELISTOR in patients with these conditions or other conditions which might result in impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g., Crohn's disease). Monitor for the development of severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue RELISTOR in patients who develop this symptom [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .  



    5.2 Severe or Persistent Diarrhea



  If severe or persistent diarrhea occurs during treatment, advise patients to discontinue therapy with RELISTOR and consult their healthcare provider.



    5.3 Opioid Withdrawal



   Symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including hyperhidrosis, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, and yawning have occurred in patients treated with RELISTOR [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 One single-arm, open-label, 78-week trial has been conducted in 29 patients with HoFH, 23 of whom completed at least one year of treatment. The initial dosage of JUXTAPID was 5 mg daily, with titration up to 60 mg daily during an 18-week period based on safety and tolerability. In this trial, the mean age was 30.7 years (range, 18 to 55 years), 16 (55%) patients were men, 25 (86%) patients were Caucasian, 2 (7%) were Asian, 1 (3%) was African American, and 1 (3%) was multi-racial  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  .



 Five (17%) of the 29 patients with HoFH that participated in the clinical trial discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that contributed to treatment discontinuations included diarrhea (2 patients; 7%) and abdominal pain, nausea, gastroenteritis, weight loss, headache, and difficulty controlling INR on warfarin (1 patient each; 3%).



 The most common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal, reported by 27 (93%) of 29 patients. Adverse reactions reported by >=8 (28%) patients in the HoFH clinical trial included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Other common adverse reactions, reported by 5 to 7 (17-24%) patients, included weight loss, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, constipation, flatulence, increased ALT, chest pain, influenza, nasopharyngitis, and fatigue.



 The adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of patients during the HoFH clinical trial are presented in Table 3.

      Adverse reactions of severe intensity were reported by 8 (28%) of 29 patients, with the most common being diarrhea (4 patients, 14%), vomiting (3 patients, 10%), increased ALT or hepatotoxicity (3 patients, 10%), and abdominal pain, distension, and/or discomfort (2 patients, 7%).
 

   Transaminase Elevations  



 During the HoFH clinical trial, 10 (34%) of 29 patients had at least one elevation in ALT and/or AST >=3x ULN (see Table 4). No clinically meaningful elevations in total bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase were observed. Transaminases typically fell within one to four weeks of reducing the dose or withholding JUXTAPID.

   Hepatic Steatosis  



 Hepatic fat was prospectively measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in all eligible patients during the HoFH clinical trial. After 26 weeks, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat from baseline was 6%, and the mean absolute increase was 8% (range, 0% to 30%). After 78 weeks, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat from baseline was 6%, and the mean absolute increase was 7% (range, 0% to 18%). Among the 23 patients with evaluable data, on at least one occasion during the trial, 18 (78%) exhibited an increase in hepatic fat >5% and 3 (13%) exhibited an increase >20%. Data from individuals who had repeat measurements after stopping JUXTAPID show that hepatic fat accumulation is reversible, but whether histological sequelae remain is unknown.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY

  WARNING: RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY

    JUXTAPID can cause elevations in transaminases. In the JUXTAPID clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients treated with JUXTAPID had at least one elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >=3x upper limit of normal (ULN). There were no concomitant clinically meaningful elevations of total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), or alkaline phosphatase   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].    



   JUXTAPID also increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. The median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID treatment may be a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].    



   Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment and then ALT and AST regularly as recommended. During treatment, adjust the dose of JUXTAPID if the ALT or AST are >=3x ULN. Discontinue JUXTAPID for clinically significant liver toxicity [  see   Dosage and Administration (2.4)   and   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].    



   Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, JUXTAPID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the JUXTAPID REMS Program   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].

   5.1 Risk of Hepatotoxicity



  JUXTAPID can cause elevations in transaminases and hepatic steatosis, as described below [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  . To what extent JUXTAPID-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the elevations in transaminases is unknown. Although cases of hepatic dysfunction (elevated transaminases with increase in bilirubin or INR) or hepatic failure have not been reported, there is concern that JUXTAPID could induce steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of JUXTAPID in HoFH would have been unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size and duration [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  .



  Elevation of Transaminases  



 Elevations in transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) are associated with JUXTAPID. In the clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients with HoFH had at least one elevation in ALT or AST >=3x ULN, and 4 (14%) of the patients had at least one elevation in ALT or AST >=5x ULN. There were no concomitant or subsequent clinically meaningful elevations in bilirubin, INR, or alkaline phosphatase [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 During the 78-week HoFH clinical trial, no patients discontinued prematurely because of elevated transaminases. Among the 19 patients who subsequently enrolled in the HoFH extension study, one discontinued because of increased transaminases that persisted despite several dose reductions, and one temporarily discontinued because of markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24x ULN, AST 13x ULN) that had several possible causes, including a drug-drug interaction between JUXTAPID and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .



 Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiation of treatment with JUXTAPID [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . JUXTAPID is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, or active liver disease, including unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. If the baseline liver-related tests are abnormal, one may consider initiating JUXTAPID after an appropriate work-up and the baseline abnormalities are explained or resolved. During the first year, measure liver-related tests (ALT and AST, at a minimum) prior to each increase in dose or monthly, whichever occurs first. After the first year, do these tests at least every 3 months and before any increase in dose. Modify the dose of JUXTAPID if elevations of transaminases are observed and discontinue JUXTAPID for persistent or clinically significant elevations [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  .



 If transaminase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, lethargy, flu-like symptoms), increases in bilirubin >=2x ULN, or active liver disease, discontinue treatment with JUXTAPID and identify the probable cause.



  Hepatic Steatosis  



 JUXTAPID increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. The long-term consequences of hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID treatment are unknown. During the HoFH clinical trial, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 weeks and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Clinical data suggest that hepatic fat accumulation is reversible after stopping treatment with JUXTAPID, but whether histological sequelae remain is unknown, especially after long-term use; protocol liver biopsies were not performed in the HoFH clinical trial.



 Alcohol may increase levels of hepatic fat and induce or exacerbate liver injury. It is recommended that patients taking JUXTAPID should not consume more than one alcoholic drink per day.



 Caution should be exercised when JUXTAPID is used with other medications known to have potential for hepatotoxicity, such as isotretinoin, amiodarone, acetaminophen (>4 g/day for >=3 days/week), methotrexate, tetracyclines, and tamoxifen. The effect of concomitant administration of JUXTAPID with other hepatotoxic medications is unknown. More frequent monitoring of liver-related tests may be warranted.



 JUXTAPID has not been studied concomitantly with other LDL-lowering agents that can also increase hepatic fat. Therefore, the combined use of such agents is not recommended.



    5.2 JUXTAPID REMS Program



  Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with JUXTAPID therapy, JUXTAPID is available through a restricted program under the REMS. Under the JUXTAPID REMS, only certified healthcare providers and pharmacies may prescribe and distribute JUXTAPID. Further information is available at www.JUXTAPIDREMSProgram.com  or by telephone at 1-85-JUXTAPID (1-855-898-2743).



    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  JUXTAPID may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings of teratogenicity in rats and ferrets [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  . Females of reproductive potential should have a negative pregnancy test before starting JUXTAPID and should use effective contraception during therapy with JUXTAPID [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  . If oral contraceptives are used, the maximum recommended dosage of JUXTAPID is 30 mg daily [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



    5.4 Reduced Absorption of Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Serum Fatty Acids



  Given its mechanism of action in the small intestine, JUXTAPID may reduce the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. In the HoFH clinical trial, patients were provided daily dietary supplements of vitamin E, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In this trial, the median levels of serum vitamin E, ALA, linoleic acid, EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid decreased from baseline to Week 26 but remained above the lower limit of the reference range. Adverse clinical consequences of these reductions were not observed with JUXTAPID treatment of up to 78 weeks. Patients treated with JUXTAPID should take daily supplements that contain 400 international units vitamin E and at least 200 mg linoleic acid, 210 mg ALA, 110 mg EPA, and 80 mg DHA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . Patients with chronic bowel or pancreatic diseases that predispose to malabsorption may be at increased risk for deficiencies in these nutrients with use of JUXTAPID.



    5.5 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions



  Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported by 27 (93%) of 29 patients in the HoFH clinical trial. Diarrhea occurred in 79% of patients, nausea in 65%, dyspepsia in 38%, and vomiting in 34%. Other reactions reported by at least 20% of patients include abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, constipation, and flatulence [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



 Gastrointestinal adverse reactions of severe intensity were reported by 6 (21%) of 29 patients in the HoFH clinical trial, with the most common being diarrhea (4 patients, 14%); vomiting (3 patients, 10%); and abdominal pain, distension, and/or discomfort (2 patients, 7%). Gastrointestinal reactions contributed to the reasons for early discontinuation from the trial for 4 (14%) patients.



 Absorption of concomitant oral medications may be affected in patients who develop diarrhea or vomiting.



 To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events, patients should adhere to a low-fat diet supplying <20% of energy from fat and the dosage of JUXTAPID should be increased gradually [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  and  (2.2)  ]  .



    5.6 Concomitant Use of CYP3A4 Inhibitors



  CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of lomitapide, with strong inhibitors increasing exposure approximately 27-fold. Concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with JUXTAPID is contraindicated [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  . In the JUXTAPID clinical trials, one patient with HoFH developed markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24x ULN, AST 13x ULN) within days of initiating the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin. If treatment with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, JUXTAPID should be stopped during the course of treatment.



 Grapefruit juice must be omitted from the diet while being treated with JUXTAPID.



 Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of lomitapide approximately 2-fold; therefore, JUXTAPID dosage should not exceed 30 mg daily when it is used concomitantly with these inhibitors, including atorvastatin and oral contraceptives [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



    5.7 Risk of Myopathy with Concomitant Use of Simvastatin or Lovastatin



  The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, with simvastatin and lovastatin monotherapy is dose related. Lomitapide approximately doubles the exposure to simvastatin; therefore, it is recommended to reduce the dose of simvastatin by 50% when initiating JUXTAPID [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . While taking JUXTAPID, limit simvastatin dosage to 20 mg daily (or 40 mg daily for patients who have previously tolerated simvastatin 80 mg daily for at least one year without evidence of muscle toxicity). Refer to the simvastatin prescribing information for additional dosing recommendations.



 Interaction between lovastatin and lomitapide has not been studied. However, the metabolizing enzymes and transporters responsible for the disposition of lovastatin and simvastatin are similar, suggesting that JUXTAPID may increase the exposure of lovastatin; therefore, reducing the dose of lovastatin should be considered when initiating JUXTAPID.



    5.8 Risk of Supratherapeutic or Subtherapeutic Anticoagulation with Warfarin



  JUXTAPID increases the plasma concentrations of warfarin. Increases in the dose of JUXTAPID may lead to supratherapeutic anticoagulation, and decreases in the dose of JUXTAPID may lead to subtherapeutic anticoagulation. Difficulty controlling INR contributed to early discontinuation from the HoFH clinical trial for one of five patients taking concomitant warfarin. Patients taking warfarin should undergo regular monitoring of the INR, especially after any changes in JUXTAPID dosage. The dose of warfarin should be adjusted as clinically indicated [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .



    5.9 Risk of Malabsorption with Rare Hereditary Disorders of Galactose Intolerance



  Patients with rare, hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should avoid JUXTAPID as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption.

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Patient Exposure  



 Savella was evaluated in three double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving 2209 fibromyalgia patients (1557 patients treated with Savella and 652 patients treated with placebo) for a treatment period up to 29 weeks.



 The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  



 In placebo-controlled trials in patients with fibromyalgia, 23% of patients treated with Savella



 100 mg/day, 26% of patients treated with Savella 200 mg/day discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions, compared to 12% of patients treated with placebo. The adverse reactions that led to withdrawal in >= 1% of patients in the Savella treatment group and with an incidence rate greater than that in the placebo treatment group were nausea (milnacipran 6%, placebo 1%), palpitations (milnacipran 3%, placebo 1%), headache (milnacipran 2%, placebo 0%), constipation (milnacipran 1%, placebo 0%), heart rate increased (milnacipran 1%, placebo 0%), hyperhidrosis (milnacipran 1%, placebo 0%), vomiting (milnacipran 1%, placebo 0%), and dizziness (milnacipran 1% and placebo 0.5%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was generally more common among patients treated with Savella 200 mg/day compared to Savella 100 mg/day.



     Most Common Adverse Reactions in Placebo Controlled Trials  



 In the placebo-controlled fibromyalgia patient trials, the most frequently occurring adverse reaction in clinical trials was nausea. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5% and twice placebo) in patients treated with Savella were constipation, hot flush, hyperhidrosis, vomiting, palpitations, heart rate increased, dry mouth, and hypertension.



     Table 4    lists all adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with Savella at either 100 or 200 mg/day and at an incidence greater than that of placebo.

 In placebo-controlled fibromyalgia clinical trials, patients treated with Savella for up to 3 months experienced a mean weight loss of approximately 0.8 kg in both the Savella 100 mg/day and the Savella 200 mg/day treatment groups, compared with a mean weight loss of approximately 0.2 kg in placebo-treated patients.



     Genitourinary Adverse Reactions in Males  



 In the placebo-controlled fibromyalgia studies, the following treatment-emergent adverse reactions related to the genitourinary system were observed in at least 2% of male patients treated with Savella, and occurred at a rate greater than in placebo-treated male patients: dysuria, ejaculation disorder, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation failure, libido decreased, prostatitis, scrotal pain, testicular pain, testicular swelling, urinary hesitation, urinary retention, urethral pain, and urine flow decreased.



     Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Trials of Savella in Fibromyalgia  



 Following is a list of frequent (those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients) treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported from 1824 fibromyalgia patients treated with Savella for periods up to 68 weeks. The listing does not include those events already listed in    Table 4    , those events for which a drug cause was remote, those events which were so general as to be uninformative, and those events reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life threatening.



 Adverse reactions are categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency. Adverse reactions of major clinical importance are described in the  Warnings and Precautions section (  5  )  .



 Gastrointestinal Disorders - diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, flatulence, abdominal distension



 General Disorders - fatigue, peripheral edema, irritability, pyrexia



 Infections - urinary tract infection, cystitis



 Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications - contusion, fall



 Investigations - weight decreased or increased



 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders - hypercholesterolemia



 Nervous System Disorders - somnolence, dysgeusia



 Psychiatric Disorders - depression, stress



 Skin Disorders - night sweats



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reports of Savella received worldwide. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion because of a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to Savella. However, because these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events include:



 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders - leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia



 Cardiac Disorders - supraventricular tachycardia



 Eye Disorders - accommodation disorder



 Endocrine Disorders - hyperprolactinemia



 Hepatobiliary Disorders - hepatitis

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS 

  WARNING: SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS 

    Savella is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), similar to some drugs used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders. Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of such drugs in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on Savella should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Savella is not approved for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Savella is not approved for use in pediatric patients   [see Indications and Usage (  1  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  )]    . 



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Increased risk of suicidal ideation, thinking, and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders (5.1). 
 *  Savella is not approved for use in pediatric patients (1, 8.4).

SAVELLA,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Suicidality: Monitor for worsening of depressive symptoms and suicide risk (  5.1  ). 
 *    Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Savella, both when taken alone, but especially when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone and St. John's Wort). If such symptoms occur, discontinue Savella and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of Savella with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment and dose increases (  5.2  ). 
 *    Elevated blood pressure and heart rate: Savella may increase blood pressure and heart rate. In an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring study, a substantially higher proportion of Savella-treated patients experienced clinically significant blood pressure and heart rate elevations as compared with placebo-treated patients. Measure blood pressure and heart rate prior to initiating treatment with Savella and monitor periodically throughout treatment (  5.3  ,  5.4  ). 
 *    Seizures: Cases have been reported with Savella therapy. Prescribe Savella with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder (  5.5  ). 
 *    Hepatotoxicity: More patients treated with Savella than with placebo experienced mild elevations of ALT and AST. Rarely, fulminant hepatitis has been reported in patients treated with Savella. Avoid concomitant use of Savella in patients with substantial alcohol use or chronic liver disease (  5.6  ). 
 *    Discontinuation: Withdrawal symptoms have been reported in patients when discontinuing treatment with Savella. A gradual dose reduction is recommended (  5.7  ). 
 *    Abnormal Bleeding: Savella may increase the risk of bleeding events. Caution patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Savella and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation (  5.9  ). 
 *    Male patients with a history of obstructive uropathies may experience higher rates of genitourinary adverse events (  5.11  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Suicide Risk



  Savella is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor (SNRI), similar to some drugs used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders.



 Patients, both adult and pediatric, with depression or other psychiatric disorders may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking these medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants, including drugs that inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin, may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.



 In the placebo-controlled clinical trials of adults with fibromyalgia, among the patients who had a history of depression at treatment initiation, the incidence of suicidal ideation was 0.5% in patients treated with placebo, 0% in patients treated with Savella 100 mg/day, and 1.3% in patients treated with Savella 200 mg/day. No suicides occurred in the short-term or longer-term (up to 1 year) fibromyalgia trials.



 Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of drugs used to treat depression (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with these drugs compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in suicidality risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults age 65 and older.



 The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 drugs used to treat depression in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients.



 There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk of differences (drug versus placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in   Table 1    .

        No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.
 

 It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.



 However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.



  All patients being treated with drugs inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases  .



 The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with drugs inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.



 Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients who may experience worsening depressive symptoms, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe or abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.



 If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment due to worsening depressive symptoms or emergent suicidality, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can produce withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.4  ), and Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  )]  .



  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with drugs inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for Savella should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.  



    5.2 Serotonin Syndrome



  The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Savella, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).



 Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.



 The concomitant use of Savella with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Savella should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Savella. Savella should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (  4.1  ), Dosage and Administration (  2.5  ,  2.6  )].  



 If concomitant use of Savella with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.



 Treatment with Savella and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur, and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.



    5.3 Elevated Blood Pressure



  A double-blind, placebo-controlled ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) study was conducted to evaluate the effects of milnacipran (up to 200 mg/day) on blood pressure in 321 fibromyalgia patients. Among fibromyalgia patients who were normotensive at baseline, an analysis of the blood pressure findings demonstrated a substantially higher proportion of Savella-treated patients had a hypertensive blood pressure measurement at the Week 4, 50 mg BID steady state visit (17.7% [n=21/119]) and the Week 7, 100 mg BID steady state visit (14.3% [n=15/105]) as compared to placebo-treated patients (3.7% [n=2/54] and 0% [0/49] at the Week 4 and Week 7 visits, respectively). Hypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg and change from baseline in mean SBP >=10 mmHg or mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=90 mmHg and change from baseline in mean DBP >=5 mmHg for the 12-hour period post AM study drug measurement at that visit. Furthermore, 1.9% (4/210) of Savella-treated and 0.9% (1/111) of placebo patients discontinued treatment for increases in blood pressure.



 The increased risk of blood pressure measurements in the hypertensive range in Savella-treated patients is supported by substantial increases in mean SBP and DBP measurements observed in the ABPM study.   Table 2    shows that, following treatment with Savella 50 mg BID for three weeks in patients who were normotensive at baseline, the mean increase from baseline was 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). After further treatment with Savella 100 mg BID for two weeks, the mean increase from baseline in SBP and DBP was 6 mmHg. Similar elevations occurred in Savella-treated patients who were hypertensive at baseline.

             Similar patterns of treatment-emergent blood pressure elevations were observed in Phase 3 and clinical pharmacology studies as manifested by an increased risk of new onset hypertension or substantial increases in end of study blood pressure measurements in patients with hypertension at baseline (   Table 3    ).

          Sustained increases in blood pressure may have adverse consequences. Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported.
 

 Concomitant use of Savella with drugs that increase blood pressure and heart rate has not been evaluated and such combinations should be used with caution [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 Effects of Savella on blood pressure in patients with significant hypertension or cardiac disease have not been systematically evaluated. Savella should be used with caution in these patients.



 Measure blood pressure prior to initiating treatment and periodically monitor blood pressure throughout Savella treatment. Treat pre-existing hypertension and other cardiovascular disease before starting therapy with Savella. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving Savella, either reduce the dose or discontinue treatment with Savella if clinically warranted.



    5.4 Elevated Heart Rate



  A double-blind, placebo-controlled ABPM study was conducted to evaluate the effects of milnacipran (up to 200 mg/day) on blood pressure in 321 fibromyalgia patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  . Information on heart rate was also collected. Following treatment with Savella 50mg BID for three weeks in patients who were normotensive at baseline, the mean increase in mean 24-hour heart rate from baseline was 13 beats per minute. After further treatment with Savella 100 mg BID for two weeks, the mean increase from baseline in heart rate was 13 beats per minute.



 Similar trends were observed in the clinical trials where Savella treatment was associated with mean increases in heart rate of approximately 7 to 8 beats per minute [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ]  .



 Increases in heart rate >= 20 beats per minute occurred more frequently in Savella-treated patients when compared to placebo (8% in the Savella 50 mg BID and 100 mg BID treatment arms versus 0.3% in the placebo arm).



 Savella has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a cardiac rhythm disorder.



 Measure heart rate prior to initiating treatment and periodically monitor the heart rate throughout Savella treatment. Treat pre-existing tachyarrhythmias and other cardiac disease before starting therapy with Savella. For patients who experience a sustained increase in heart rate while receiving Savella, either reduce the dose or discontinue treatment with Savella if clinically warranted.



    5.5 Seizures



  Savella has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. In clinical trials evaluating Savella in patients with fibromyalgia, seizures/convulsions have not been reported. However, seizures have been reported infrequently in patients treated with Savella for disorders other than fibromyalgia. Savella should be prescribed with care in patients with a history of a seizure disorder.



    5.6 Hepatotoxicity



  In the placebo-controlled fibromyalgia trials, increases in the number of patients treated with Savella with mild elevations of ALT or AST (1-3 times the upper limit of normal, ULN) were observed. Increases in ALT were more frequently observed in the patients treated with Savella 100 mg/day (6%) and Savella 200 mg/day (7%), compared to the patients treated with placebo (3%). One patient receiving Savella 100 mg/day (0.2%) had an increase in ALT greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal but did not exceed 10 times the upper limit of normal. Increases in AST were more frequently observed in the patients treated with Savella 100 mg/day (3%) and Savella 200 mg/day (5%) compared to the patients treated with placebo (2%).



 The increases of bilirubin observed in the fibromyalgia clinical trials were not clinically significant.



 No case met the criteria of elevated ALT > 3x ULN and associated with an increase in bilirubin >= 2x ULN.



 There have been cases of increased liver enzymes and reports of severe liver injury, including fulminant hepatitis with milnacipran from foreign postmarketing experience. In the cases of severe liver injury, there were significant underlying clinical conditions and/or the use of multiple concomitant medications. Because of underreporting, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the true incidence of these reactions.



 Savella should be discontinued in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of liver dysfunction. Treatment with Savella should not be resumed unless another cause can be established.



 Savella should ordinarily not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease.



    5.7 Discontinuation of Treatment with Savella



  Withdrawal symptoms have been observed in clinical trials following discontinuation of milnacipran, as with other SNRIs and SSRIs.



 During marketing of milnacipran, and other SNRIs and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events indicative of withdrawal and physical dependence occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when discontinuation is abrupt. The adverse events include the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. Although these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe.



 Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Savella. Savella should be tapered and not abruptly discontinued after extended use. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )]  .



    5.8 Hyponatremia



  Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Savella. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs, SSRIs, or Savella. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted may be at greater risk [see Geriatric Use (  8.5  )]  . Discontinuation of Savella should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia.



 Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.



    5.9 Abnormal Bleeding



  SSRIs and SNRIs, including Savella, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.



 Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Savella and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation.



    5.10 Activation of Mania



  No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in the clinical trials evaluating effects of Savella in patients with fibromyalgia. However those clinical trials excluded patients with current major depressive episode. Activation of mania and hypomania have been reported in patients with mood disorders who were treated with other similar drugs for major depressive disorder. As with these other agents, Savella should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.



    5.11 Patients with a History of Dysuria



  Because of their noradrenergic effect, SNRIs including Savella, can affect urethral resistance and micturition. In the controlled fibromyalgia trials, dysuria occurred more frequently in patients treated with Savella (1%) than in placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Caution is advised in use of Savella in patients with a history of dysuria, notably in male patients with prostatic hypertrophy, prostatitis, and other lower urinary tract obstructive disorders. Male patients are more prone to genitourinary adverse effects, such as dysuria or urinary retention, and may experience testicular pain or ejaculation disorders.



    5.12 Angle Closure Glaucoma



  The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of SNRI drugs including Savella may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.



    5.13 Concomitant Use with Alcohol



  In clinical trials, more patients treated with Savella developed elevated transaminases than did placebo treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  )]  . Because it is possible that milnacipran may aggravate pre-existing liver disease, Savella should not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse event information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.



 In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials, 607 hyponatremic patients (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) were treated with SAMSCA. The mean age of these patients was 62 years; 70% of patients were male and 82% were Caucasian. One hundred eighty nine (189) tolvaptan-treated patients had a serum sodium <130 mEq/L, and 52 patients had a serum sodium <125 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was attributed to cirrhosis in 17% of patients, heart failure in 68% and SIADH/other in 16%. Of these patients, 223 were treated with the recommended dose titration (15 mg titrated to 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium).



 Overall, over 4,000 patients have been treated with oral doses of tolvaptan in open-label or placebo-controlled clinical trials. Approximately 650 of these patients had hyponatremia; approximately 219 of these hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan for 6 months or more.



 The most common adverse reactions (incidence >=5% more than placebo) seen in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled hyponatremia trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses (15 mg to 60 mg once daily) were thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria and hyperglycemia. In these trials, 10% (23/223) of tolvaptan-treated patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, compared to 12% (26/220) of placebo-treated patients; no adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of trial medication occurred at an incidence of >1% in tolvaptan-treated patients.



 Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in tolvaptan-treated patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) and at a rate at least 2% greater than placebo-treated patients in two 30-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In these studies, 223 patients were exposed to tolvaptan (starting dose 15 mg, titrated to 30 and 60 mg as needed to raise serum sodium). Adverse events resulting in death in these trials were 6% in tolvaptan-treated-patients and 6% in placebo-treated patients.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of SAMSCA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Neurologic:  Osmotic demyelination syndrome



   Investigations:  Hypernatremia



 *     Removal of excess free body water increases serum osmolality and serum sodium concentrations. All patients treated with tolvaptan, especially those whose serum sodium levels become normal, should continue to be monitored to ensure serum sodium remains within normal limits. If hypernatremia is observed, management may include dose decreases or interruption of tolvaptan treatment, combined with modification of free-water intake or infusion. During clinical trials of hyponatremic patients, hypernatremia was reported as an adverse event in 0.7% of patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.6% of patients receiving placebo; analysis of laboratory values demonstrated an incidence of hypernatremia of 1.7% in patients receiving tolvaptan vs. 0.8% in patients receiving placebo.

   5.1 Too Rapid Correction of Serum Sodium Can Cause Serious Neurologic Sequelae



   (see  BOXED WARNING  )  



 Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with too rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g., >12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable. In controlled clinical trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with SAMSCA therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . Patients treated with SAMSCA should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving SAMSCA who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with SAMSCA and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy with SAMSCA may increase the likelihood of overly-rapid correction of serum sodium, and should generally be avoided.



    5.2 Liver Injury



   SAMSCA can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. In a placebo-controlled and open label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan were observed. An increased incidence of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was associated with tolvaptan (42/958 or 4.4%) compared to placebo (5/484 or 1.0%). Cases of serious liver injury were generally observed starting 3 months after initiation of tolvaptan although elevations of ALT occurred prior to 3 months.  



  Patients with symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice should discontinue treatment with SAMSCA.  



  Limit duration of therapy with SAMSCA to 30 days. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, because the ability to recover from liver injury may be impaired [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  



    5.3 Dehydration and Hypovolemia



  SAMSCA therapy induces copious aquaresis, which is normally partially offset by fluid intake. Dehydration and hypovolemia can occur, especially in potentially volume-depleted patients receiving diuretics or those who are fluid restricted. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials in which 607 hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan, the incidence of dehydration was 3.3% for tolvaptan and 1.5% for placebo-treated patients. In patients receiving SAMSCA who develop medically significant signs or symptoms of hypovolemia, interrupt or discontinue SAMSCA therapy and provide supportive care with careful management of vital signs, fluid balance and electrolytes. Fluid restriction during therapy with SAMSCA may increase the risk of dehydration and hypovolemia. Patients receiving SAMSCA should continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst.



    5.4 Co-administration with Hypertonic Saline



  Concomitant use with hypertonic saline is not recommended.



    5.5 Drug Interactions



   Other Drugs Affecting Exposure to Tolvaptan  



   CYP 3A Inhibitors



 Tolvaptan is a substrate of CYP 3A. CYP 3A inhibitors can lead to a marked increase in tolvaptan concentrations [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  Do not use SAMSCA with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A [see  Contraindications (4.4)  ]  and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP 3A inhibitors.



   CYP 3A Inducers



 Avoid co-administration of CYP 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's Wort) with SAMSCA, as this can lead to a reduction in the plasma concentration of tolvaptan and decreased effectiveness of SAMSCA treatment. If co-administered with CYP 3A inducers, the dose of SAMSCA may need to be increased [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  



   P-gp Inhibitors



 The dose of SAMSCA may have to be reduced when SAMSCA is co-administered with P-gp inhibitors, e.g., cyclosporine [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  



    5.6 Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium



  Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium >5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Approximately 800 patients have been treated with an intravitreal injection of JETREA. Of these, 465 patients received an intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin 0.125 mg (187 patients received vehicle) in the 2 vehicle-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2).



 The most common adverse reactions (incidence 5% - 20% listed in descending order of frequency) in the vehicle-controlled clinical studies were: vitreous floaters, conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, photopsia, blurred vision, macular hole, reduced visual acuity, visual impairment, and retinal edema.



 Less common adverse reactions observed in the studies at a frequency of 2% - < 5% in patients treated with JETREA included macular edema, increased intraocular pressure, anterior chamber cell, photophobia, vitreous detachment, ocular discomfort, iritis, cataract, dry eye, metamorphopsia, conjunctival hyperemia, and retinal degeneration.



 Dyschromatopsia was reported in 2% of patients injected with JETREA, with the majority of cases reported from two uncontrolled clinical studies. In approximately half of these dyschromatopsia cases there were also electroretinographic (ERG) changes reported (a- and b-wave amplitude decrease).

   EXCERPT:    *  Decreases in vision due to progression of the condition with traction may occur requiring surgical intervention. Patients should be monitored and instructed to report any symptoms without delay.  (5.1)   
 *  Intravitreal injection procedure associated effects (intraocular inflammation/infection, intraocular hemorrhage and increased IOP) may occur following an intravitreal injection. Patients should be monitored and instructed to report any symptoms without delay.  (5.2)   
 *  Potential for lens subluxation.  (5.3)   
    
 

   5.1 Decreased Vision



  A decrease of >= 3 line of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was experienced by 5.6% of patients treated with JETREA and 3.2% of patients treated with vehicle in the controlled trials [see Clinical Studies  (14)  ]  .



 The majority of these decreases in vision were due to progression of the condition with traction and many required surgical intervention. Patients should be monitored appropriately [see Dosage and Administration  (2.4)  ]  .



    5.2 Intravitreal Injection Procedure Associated Effects



  Intravitreal injections are associated with intraocular inflammation / infection, intraocular hemorrhage and increased intraocular pressure (IOP). In the controlled trials, intraocular inflammation occurred in 7.1% of patients injected with JETREA vs. 3.7% of patients injected with vehicle. Most of the post-injection intraocular inflammation events were mild and transient. Intraocular hemorrhage occurred in 2.4% vs. 3.7% of patients injected with JETREA vs. vehicle, respectively. Increased intraocular pressure occurred in 4.1% vs. 5.3% of patients injected with JETREA vs. vehicle, respectively.



    5.3 Potential for Lens Subluxation



  One case of lens subluxation was reported in a premature infant who received an intravitreal injection of 0.175 mg (1.4 times higher than the recommended dose) [see Pediatric Use  (8.4)  ]  . Lens subluxation was observed in three animal species (monkey, rabbit, minipig) following a single intravitreal injection that achieved vitreous concentrations of ocriplasmin 1.4 times higher than achieved with the recommended treatment dose. Administration of a second intravitreal dose in monkeys, 28 days apart, produced lens subluxation in 100% of the treated eyes [see Nonclinical Toxicology  (13.2)  ]  .



    5.4 Retinal Breaks



  In the controlled trials, the incidence of retinal detachment was 0.9% in the JETREA group and 1.6% in the vehicle group, while the incidence of retinal tear (without detachment) was 1.1% in the JETREA group and 2.7% in the vehicle group. Most of these events occurred during or after vitrectomy in both groups. The incidence of retinal detachment that occurred pre-vitrectomy was 0.4% in the JETREA group and none in the vehicle group, while the incidence of retinal tear (without detachment) that occurred pre-vitrectomy was none in the JETREA group and 0.5% in the vehicle group.



    5.5 Dyschromatopsia



  Dyschromatopsia (generally described as yellowish vision) was reported in 2% of all patients injected with JETREA. In approximately half of these dyschromatopsia cases there were also electroretinographic (ERG) changes reported (a- and b-wave amplitude decrease).

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The data described in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS section and below reflect exposure to OPDIVO in Trial 1, a randomized trial in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and in Trial 3, a single-arm trial in patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).



 Clinically significant adverse reactions were evaluated in a total of 691 patients enrolled in Trials 1, 3, or an additional dose finding study (n=306) administering OPDIVO at doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1  ,  5.6)  ]  .



   Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma

  The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in Trial 1, a randomized, open-label trial in which 370 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=268) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=102), either dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks or the combination of carboplatin AUC 6 every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks  [see      Clinical Studies (14.1)      ]  . The median duration of exposure was 5.3 months (range: 1 day to 13.8+ months) with a median of eight doses (range: 1 to 31) in OPDIVO-treated patients and was 2 months (range: 1 day to 9.6+ months) in chemotherapy treated patients. In this ongoing trial, 24% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 6 months and 3% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 1 year.



 In Trial 1, patients had documented disease progression following treatment with ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, prior ipilimumab-related Grade 4 adverse reactions (except for endocrinopathies) or Grade 3 ipilimumab-related adverse reactions that had not resolved or were inadequately controlled within 12 weeks of the initiating event, patients with a condition requiring chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications, a positive test for hepatitis B or C, and a history of HIV.



 The study population characteristics in the OPDIVO group and the chemotherapy group were similar: 66% male, median age 59.5 years, 98% white, baseline ECOG performance status 0 (59%) or 1 (41%), 74% with M1c stage disease, 73% with cutaneous melanoma, 11% with mucosal melanoma, 73% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease, and 18% had brain metastasis. There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with elevated LDH at baseline (51% vs. 38%).



 OPDIVO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of patients. Twenty-six percent of patients receiving OPDIVO had a drug delay for an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in 2% to less than 5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased lipase.



 Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of OPDIVO-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction (reported in at least 20% of patients) was rash.

   The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in Trial 3, a single-arm multinational, multicenter trial in 117 patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC and progression on both a prior platinum-based therapy and at least one additional systemic therapy  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  . Patients received 3 mg/kg of OPDIVO administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks. The median duration of therapy was 2.3 months (range: 1 day to 16.1+ months). Patients received a median of 6 doses (range: 1 to 34).



 Trial 3 excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, or untreated brain metastasis. The median age of patients was 65 years (range: 37 to 87) with 50% >=65 years of age and 14% >=75 years of age. The majority of patients were male (73%) and white (85%). All patients received two or more prior systemic treatments. Baseline disease characteristics of the population were recurrent Stage IIIb (6%), Stage IV (94%), and brain metastases (1.7%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (22%) or 1 (78%).



 OPDIVO was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 27% of patients. Twenty-nine percent of patients receiving OPDIVO had a drug delay for an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were dyspnea, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, pneumonitis, hypercalcemia, pleural effusion, hemoptysis, and pain.



 Table 3 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, cough, nausea, and constipation.

           6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.



 Of 281 patients who were treated with OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the presence of anti-product antibodies, 24 patients (8.5%) tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-product antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in two patients (0.7%). There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile or toxicity profile with anti-product binding antibody development based on the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to OPDIVO with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   5.1 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis



  Severe pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, including fatal cases, occurred with OPDIVO treatment. Across the clinical trial experience in 691 patients with solid tumors, fatal immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 0.7% (5/691) of patients receiving OPDIVO. No cases of fatal pneumonitis occurred in Trial 1 or Trial 3; all five fatal cases occurred in a dose-finding study with OPDIVO doses of 1 mg/kg (two patients), 3 mg/kg (two patients), and 10 mg/kg (one patient).



 In Trial 1, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 3.4% (9/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO and none of the 102 patients receiving chemotherapy. Immune-mediated pneumonitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology, occurred in 2.2% (6/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO: one with Grade 3 and five with Grade 2 pneumonitis. The median time to onset for the six cases was 2.2 months (range: 25 days to 3.5 months). In two patients, pneumonitis was diagnosed after discontinuation of OPDIVO for other reasons, and Grade 2 pneumonitis led to interruption or permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in the remaining four patients. All six patients received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day); immune-mediated pneumonitis improved to Grade 0 or 1 with corticosteroids in all six patients. There were two patients with Grade 2 pneumonitis that completely resolved (defined as complete resolution of symptoms with completion of corticosteroids) and OPDIVO was restarted without recurrence of pneumonitis.



  In Trial 3, pneumonitis occurred in 6% (7/117) of patients receiving OPDIVO, including five Grade 3 and two Grade 2 cases, all immune-mediated. The median time to onset was 3.3 months (range: 1.4 to 13.5 months). All seven patients discontinued OPDIVO for pneumonitis or another event and all seven patients experienced complete resolution of pneumonitis following receipt of high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day).  



 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis, followed by corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue OPDIVO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) pneumonitis and withhold OPDIVO until resolution for moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.2 Immune-Mediated Colitis



  In Trial 1, diarrhea or colitis occurred in 21% (57/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO and 18% (18/102) of patients receiving chemotherapy. Immune-mediated colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate etiology, occurred in 2.2% (6/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO: five patients with Grade 3 and one patient with Grade 2 colitis. The median time to onset of immune-mediated colitis from initiation of OPDIVO was 2.5 months (range: 1 to 6 months). In three patients, colitis was diagnosed after discontinuation of OPDIVO for other reasons, and Grade 2 or 3 colitis led to interruption or permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in the remaining three patients. Five of these six patients received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents) for a median duration of 1.4 months (range: 3 days to 2.4 months) preceding corticosteroid taper. The sixth patient continued on low-dose corticosteroids started for another immune-mediated adverse reaction. Immune-mediated colitis improved to Grade 0 with corticosteroids in five patients, including one patient with Grade 3 colitis retreated after complete resolution (defined as improved to Grade 0 with completion of corticosteroids) without additional events of colitis. Grade 2 colitis was ongoing in one patient.



  In Trial 3, diarrhea occurred in 21% (24/117) of patients. Immune-mediated colitis (Grade 3) occurred in 0.9% (1/117) of patients. The time to onset in this patient was 6.7 months. The patient received high-dose corticosteroids and was permanently discontinued from OPDIVO. Complete resolution occurred.  



 Monitor patients for immune-mediated colitis. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by corticosteroid taper for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) colitis. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by corticosteroid taper for moderate (Grade 2) colitis of more than 5 days duration; if worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, increase dose to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents. Withhold OPDIVO for Grade 2 or 3 immune-mediated colitis. Permanently discontinue OPDIVO for Grade 4 colitis or for recurrent colitis upon restarting OPDIVO [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.3 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis



  In Trial 1, there was an increased incidence of liver test abnormalities in the OPDIVO-treated group as compared to the chemotherapy-treated group, with increases in AST (28% vs. 12%), alkaline phosphatase (22% vs. 13%), ALT (16% vs. 5%), and total bilirubin (9% vs. 0). Immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requirement for corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology, occurred in 1.1% (3/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO: two patients with Grade 3 and one patient with Grade 2 hepatitis. The time to onset was 97, 113, and 86 days after initiation of OPDIVO. In one patient, hepatitis was diagnosed after discontinuation of OPDIVO for other reasons. In two patients, OPDIVO was withheld. All three patients received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents). Liver tests improved to Grade 1 within 4 to 15 days of initiation of corticosteroids. Immune-mediated hepatitis resolved and did not recur with continuation of corticosteroids in two patients; the third patient died of disease progression with persistent hepatitis. The two patients with Grade 3 hepatitis that resolved restarted OPDIVO and, in one patient, Grade 3 immune-mediated hepatitis recurred resulting in permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO.



  In Trial 3, the incidences of increased liver test values were AST (16%), alkaline phosphatase (14%), ALT (12%), and total bilirubin (2.7%). No cases of immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in this trial.  



 Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for Grade 2 or greater transaminase elevations, with or without concomitant elevation in total bilirubin. Withhold OPDIVO for moderate (Grade 2) and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated hepatitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.4 Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction



  In Trial 1, there was an increased incidence of elevated creatinine in the OPDIVO-treated group as compared to the chemotherapy-treated group (13% vs. 9%). Grade 2 or 3 immune-mediated nephritis or renal dysfunction (defined as >= Grade 2 increased creatinine, requirement for corticosteroids, and no clear alternate etiology) occurred in 0.7% (2/268) of patients at 3.5 and 6 months after OPDIVO initiation, respectively. OPDIVO was permanently discontinued in both patients; both received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents). Immune-mediated nephritis resolved and did not recur with continuation of corticosteroids in one patient. Renal dysfunction was ongoing in one patient.



  In Trial 3, the incidence of elevated creatinine was 22%. Immune-mediated renal dysfunction (Grade 2) occurred in 0.9% (1/117) of patients. The time to onset in this patient was 0.8 months. The patient received high-dose corticosteroids. OPDIVO was withheld, and the patient discontinued due to disease progression prior to receiving additional OPDIVO. Immune-mediated renal dysfunction was ongoing.  



 Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by corticosteroid taper for life-threatening (Grade 4) serum creatinine elevation and permanently discontinue OPDIVO. For severe (Grade 3) or moderate (Grade 2) serum creatinine elevation, withhold OPDIVO and administer corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by corticosteroid taper; if worsening or no improvement occurs, increase dose of corticosteroids to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents and permanently discontinue OPDIVO [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.5 Immune-Mediated Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism



  In Trial 1, where patients were evaluated at baseline and during the trial for thyroid function, Grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (21/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO and none of the 102 patients receiving chemotherapy. The median time to onset was 2.5 months (range: 24 days to 11.7 months). Seventeen of the 21 patients with hypothyroidism received levothyroxine. Fifteen of 17 patients received subsequent OPDIVO dosing while continuing to receive levothyroxine.



 Grade 1 or 2 hyperthyroidism occurred in 3% (8/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO and 1% (1/102) of patients receiving chemotherapy. The median time to onset in OPDIVO-treated patients was 1.6 months (range: 0 to 3.3 months). Four of five patients with Grade 1 hyperthyroidism and two of three patients with Grade 2 hyperthyroidism had documented resolution of hyperthyroidism; all three patients received medical management for Grade 2 hyperthyroidism.



  In Trial 3, patients were evaluated for thyroid function at baseline, first day of treatment, and every 6 weeks. Hypothyroidism occurred in 4.3% (5/117) of patients. The median time to onset for these five cases was 4.1 months (range: 1.4 to 4.6 months). All five patients with hypothyroidism received levothyroxine. Complete resolution of hypothyroidism occurred in one patient allowing discontinuation of levothyroxine. Interruption of OPDIVO did not occur in these five patients.  



  Hyperthyroidism occurred in 1.7% (2/117) of patients. One patient experienced Grade 2 hyperthyroidism 5.2 months after the first dose of OPDIVO, requiring treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and methimazole. Thyroid laboratory tests returned to normal 4.7 months later.  



 Monitor thyroid function prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Initiate medical management for control of hyperthyroidism. There are no recommended dose adjustments of OPDIVO for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.



    5.6 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions



  Other clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur. Immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO therapy.



 The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 2% of OPDIVO-treated patients in Trials 1 and 3 (n=385): adrenal insufficiency, uveitis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, autoimmune neuropathy, motor dysfunction, and vasculitis.  



 Across clinical trials of OPDIVO administered at doses of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg the following additional clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions were identified: hypophysitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypopituitarism, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and myasthenic syndrome.



 For any suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider restarting OPDIVO after completion of corticosteroid taper based on the severity of the event [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.7 Embryofetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of Victoza has been evaluated in 8 clinical trials  [  see Clinical Studies (14)  ]  :



 *    A double-blind 52-week monotherapy trial compared Victoza 1.2 mg daily, Victoza 1.8 mg daily, and glimepiride 8 mg daily. 
 *    A double-blind 26 week add-on to metformin trial compared Victoza 0.6 mg once-daily, Victoza 1.2 mg once-daily, Victoza 1.8 mg once-daily, placebo, and glimepiride 4 mg once-daily. 
 *    A double-blind 26 week add-on to glimepiride trial compared Victoza 0.6 mg daily, Victoza 1.2 mg once-daily, Victoza 1.8 mg once-daily, placebo, and rosiglitazone 4 mg once-daily. 
 *    A 26 week add-on to metformin + glimepiride trial, compared double-blind Victoza 1.8 mg once-daily, double-blind placebo, and open-label insulin glargine once-daily. 
 *    A double-blind 26-week add-on to metformin + rosiglitazone trial compared Victoza 1.2 mg once-daily, Victoza 1.8 mg once-daily and placebo. 
 *    An open-label 26-week add-on to metformin and/or sulfonylurea trial compared Victoza 1.8 mg once-daily and exenatide 10 mcg twice-daily. 
 *    An open-label 26-week add-on to metformin trial compared Victoza 1.2 mg once-daily, Victoza 1.8 mg once-daily, and sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily. 
 *    An open-label 26-week trial compared insulin detemir as add-on to Victoza 1.8 mg + metformin to continued treatment with Victoza + metformin alone. 
      Withdrawals  
 

 The incidence of withdrawal due to adverse events was 7.8% for Victoza-treated patients and 3.4% for comparator-treated patients in the five double-blind controlled trials of 26 weeks duration or longer. This difference was driven by withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, which occurred in 5.0% of Victoza-treated patients and 0.5% of comparator-treated patients. In these five trials, the most common adverse reactions leading to withdrawal for Victoza-treated patients were nausea (2.8% versus 0% for comparator) and vomiting (1.5% versus 0.1% for comparator). Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2-3 months of the trials.



   Common adverse reactions  



 Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 summarize common adverse reactions (hypoglycemia is discussed separately) reported in seven of the eight controlled trials of 26 weeks duration or longer. Most of these adverse reactions were gastrointestinal in nature.



 In the five double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer, gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported in 41% of Victoza-treated patients and were dose-related. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred in 17% of comparator-treated patients. Common adverse reactions that occurred at a higher incidence among Victoza-treated patients included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia and constipation.



 In the five double-blind and three open-label clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer, the percentage of patients who reported nausea declined over time. In the five double-blind trials approximately 13% of Victoza-treated patients and 2% of comparator-treated patients reported nausea during the first 2 weeks of treatment.



 In the 26-week open-label trial comparing Victoza to exenatide, both in combination with metformin and/or sulfonylurea, gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported at a similar incidence in the Victoza and exenatide treatment groups (Table 3).



 In the 26-week open-label trial comparing Victoza 1.2 mg, Victoza 1.8 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg, all in combination with metformin, gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported at a higher incidence with Victoza than sitagliptin (Table 4).



 In the remaining 26-week trial, all patients received Victoza 1.8 mg + metformin during a 12-week run-in period. During the run-in period, 167 patients (17% of enrolled total) withdrew from the trial: 76 (46% of withdrawals) of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions and 15 (9% of withdrawals) doing so due to other adverse events. Only those patients who completed the run-in period with inadequate glycemic control were randomized to 26 weeks of add-on therapy with insulin detemir or continued, unchanged treatment with Victoza 1.8 mg + metformin. During this randomized 26-week period, diarrhea was the only adverse reaction reported in >=5% of patients treated with Victoza 1.8 mg + metformin + insulin detemir (11.7%) and greater than in patients treated with Victoza 1.8 mg and metformin alone (6.9%).

           Immunogenicity  
 

 Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, patients treated with Victoza may develop anti-liraglutide antibodies. Approximately 50-70% of Victoza-treated patients in the five double-blind clinical trials of 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti-liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment. Low titers (concentrations not requiring dilution of serum) of anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 8.6% of these Victoza-treated patients. Sampling was not performed uniformly across all patients in the clinical trials, and this may have resulted in an underestimate of the actual percentage of patients who developed antibodies. Cross-reacting anti-liraglutide antibodies to native glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) occurred in 6.9% of the Victoza-treated patients in the double-blind 52-week monotherapy trial and in 4.8% of the Victoza-treated patients in the double-blind 26-week add-on combination therapy trials. These cross-reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP-1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP-1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an  in vitro  assay occurred in 2.3% of the Victoza-treated patients in the double-blind 52-week monotherapy trial and in 1.0% of the Victoza-treated patients in the double-blind 26-week add-on combination therapy trials.



 Among Victoza-treated patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies, the most common category of adverse events was that of infections, which occurred among 40% of these patients compared to 36%, 34% and 35% of antibody-negative Victoza-treated, placebo-treated and active-control-treated patients, respectively. The specific infections which occurred with greater frequency among Victoza-treated antibody-positive patients were primarily nonserious upper respiratory tract infections, which occurred among 11% of Victoza-treated antibody-positive patients; and among 7%, 7% and 5% of antibody-negative Victoza-treated, placebo-treated and active-control-treated patients, respectively. Among Victoza-treated antibody-negative patients, the most common category of adverse events was that of gastrointestinal events, which occurred in 43%, 18% and 19% of antibody-negative Victoza-treated, placebo-treated and active-control-treated patients, respectively. Antibody formation was not associated with reduced efficacy of Victoza when comparing mean HbA1cof all antibody-positive and all antibody-negative patients. However, the 3 patients with the highest titers of anti-liraglutide antibodies had no reduction in HbA1cwith Victoza treatment.



 In the five double-blind clinical trials of Victoza, events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g. urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of Victoza-treated patients and among 0.4% of comparator-treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for Victoza-treated patients. Patients who developed anti-liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti-liraglutide antibodies.



   Injection site reactions  



 Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of Victoza-treated patients in the five double-blind clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of Victoza-treated patients discontinued due to injection site reactions.



   Papillary thyroid carcinoma  



 In clinical trials of Victoza, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with Victoza and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound.



   Hypoglycemia  



 In the eight clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 11 Victoza-treated patients (2.3 cases per 1000 patient-years) and in two exenatide-treated patients. Of these 11 Victoza-treated patients, six patients were concomitantly using metformin and a sulfonylurea, one was concomitantly using a sulfonylurea, two were concomitantly using metformin (blood glucose values were 65 and 94 mg/dL) and two were using Victoza as monotherapy (one of these patients was undergoing an intravenous glucose tolerance test and the other was receiving insulin as treatment during a hospital stay). For these two patients on Victoza monotherapy, the insulin treatment was the likely explanation for the hypoglycemia. 



 In the 26-week open-label trial comparing Victoza to sitagliptin, the incidence of hypoglycemic events defined as symptoms accompanied by a fingerstick glucose <56 mg/dL was comparable among the treatment groups (approximately 5%).

          In a pooled analysis of clinical trials, the incidence rate (per 1,000 patient-years) for malignant neoplasms (based on investigator-reported events, medical history, pathology reports, and surgical reports from both blinded and open-label study periods) was 10.9 for Victoza, 6.3 for placebo, and 7.2 for active comparator. After excluding papillary thyroid carcinoma events  [  see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  , no particular cancer cell type predominated. Seven malignant neoplasm events were reported beyond 1 year of exposure to study medication, six events among Victoza-treated patients (4 colon, 1 prostate and 1 nasopharyngeal), no events with placebo and one event with active comparator (colon). Causality has not been established.
 

   Laboratory Tests  



   Bilirubin  



 In the five clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of Victoza-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown.



   Calcitonin  



 Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the clinical trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in Victoza-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among patients with pretreatment calcitonin <20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to >20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of Victoza-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.



   Vital signs  



 Victoza did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed with Victoza compared to placebo. The long-term clinical effects of the increase in pulse rate have not been established  [      see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)      ]  .



   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Victoza. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING:  RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS

  WARNING:  RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS

    *  Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice. It is unknown whether Victoza causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 
 *  Victoza is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of Victoza and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with Victoza [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

    5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors  



   Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  . Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether Victoza will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.  



  Cases of MTC in patients treated with Victoza have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and Victoza use in humans.  



  Victoza is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of Victoza and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).  



  Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with Victoza. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.  



    5.2 Pancreatitis



   Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with Victoza. After initiation of Victoza, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, Victoza should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, Victoza should not be restarted. Consider antidiabetic therapies other than Victoza in patients with a history of pancreatitis.  



 In clinical trials of Victoza, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among Victoza-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with Victoza were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a Victoza-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse.



    5.3 Never Share a Victoza Pen Between Patients



  Victoza pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.



    5.4 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia



  Patients receiving Victoza in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin [  see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.5 Renal Impairment



  Victoza has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in animal studies or clinical trials. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in Victoza-treated patients   [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]    . Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration   [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]    . Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including Victoza. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of Victoza in patients with renal impairment   [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]    .



    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with Victoza. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient should discontinue Victoza and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice.



 Angioedema has also been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with Victoza.



    5.7 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Victoza or any other antidiabetic drug.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  The following serious adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:



 *    Bleeding [see  Boxed Warning  and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ,  5.2  )]  
 *    Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  
    Safety in patients with ACS undergoing PCI was evaluated in a clopidogrel-controlled study, TRITON-TIMI 38, in which 6741 patients were treated with Effient (60-mg loading dose and 10-mg once daily) for a median of 14.5 months (5802 patients were treated for over 6 months; 4136 patients were treated for more than 1 year). The population treated with Effient was 27 to 96 years of age, 25% female, and 92% Caucasian. All patients in the TRITON-TIMI 38 study were to receive aspirin. The dose of clopidogrel in this study was a 300-mg loading dose and 75-mg once daily.
 

 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials cannot be directly compared with the rates observed in other clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Drug Discontinuation  



 The rate of study drug discontinuation because of adverse reactions was 7.2% for Effient and 6.3% for clopidogrel. Bleeding was the most common adverse reaction leading to study drug discontinuation for both drugs (2.5% for Effient and 1.4% for clopidogrel).



     Bleeding  



     Bleeding Unrelated to CABG Surgery  - In TRITON-TIMI 38, overall rates of TIMI Major or Minor bleeding adverse reactions unrelated to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were significantly higher on Effient than on clopidogrel, as shown in  Table 1  .

               Bleeding Related to CABG  - In TRITON-TIMI 38, 437 patients who received a thienopyridine underwent CABG during the course of the study. The rate of CABG-related TIMI Major or Minor bleeding was 14.1% for the Effient group and 4.5% in the clopidogrel group (  see    Table 3  ). The higher risk for bleeding adverse reactions in patients treated with Effient persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of study drug.

             Bleeding Reported as Adverse Reactions  - Hemorrhagic events reported as adverse reactions in TRITON-TIMI 38 were, for Effient and clopidogrel, respectively: epistaxis (6.2%, 3.3%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1.5%, 1.0%), hemoptysis (0.6%, 0.5%), subcutaneous hematoma (0.5%, 0.2%), post-procedural hemorrhage (0.5%, 0.2%), retroperitoneal hemorrhage (0.3%, 0.2%), pericardial effusion/hemorrhage/tamponade (0.3%, 0.2%), and retinal hemorrhage (0.0%, 0.1%).
 

     Malignancies  



 During TRITON-TIMI 38, newly-diagnosed malignancies were reported in 1.6% and 1.2% of patients treated with prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively. The sites contributing to the differences were primarily colon and lung. In another Phase 3 clinical study of ACS patients not undergoing PCI, in which data for malignancies were prospectively collected, newly-diagnosed malignancies were reported in 1.8% and 1.7% of patients treated with prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively. The site of malignancies was balanced between treatment groups except for colorectal malignancies. The rates of colorectal malignancies were 0.3% prasugrel, 0.1% clopidogrel and most were detected during investigation of GI bleed or anemia. It is unclear if these observations are causally-related, are the result of increased detection because of bleeding, or are random occurrences.



     Other Adverse Events  



 In TRITON-TIMI 38, common and other important non-hemorrhagic adverse events were, for Effient and clopidogrel, respectively: severe thrombocytopenia (0.06%, 0.04%), anemia (2.2%, 2.0%), abnormal hepatic function (0.22%, 0.27%), allergic reactions (0.36%, 0.36%), and angioedema (0.06%, 0.04%).

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: BLEEDING RISK 

  WARNING: BLEEDING RISK 

    *  Effient can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 
 *  Do not use Effient in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)]. 
 *  In patients >=75 years of age, Effient is generally not recommended, because of the increased risk of fatal and intracranial bleeding and uncertain benefit, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or a history of prior MI) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
 *  Do not start Effient in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue Effient at least 7 days prior to any surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 
 *  Additional risk factors for bleeding include: body weight <60 kg; propensity to bleed; concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., warfarin, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG, or other surgical procedures in the setting of Effient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing Effient. Discontinuing Effient, particularly in the first few weeks after acute coronary syndrome, increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

EFFIENT,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    CABG-related bleeding: Risk increases in patients receiving Effient who undergo CABG (  5.2  ). 
 *    Discontinuation of Effient: Premature discontinuation increases risk of stent thrombosis, MI, and death (  5.3  ). 
 *    Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported with Effient (  5.4  ). 
 *    Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity including angioedema has been reported with Effient including in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to other thienopyridines (  5.5  ). 
    
 

   5.1 General Risk of Bleeding



  Thienopyridines, including Effient, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin >=5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of >=3 g/dL but <5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on Effient than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in  Figure 1  (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).



 Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.   Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.
 

 Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.



 Do not use Effient in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (  4.1  ,  4.2  )]  .



 Other risk factors for bleeding are:



 *    Age >=75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients >=75 years of age, use of Effient is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  ), and Clinical Trials (  14  )] . 
 *    CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )] . 
 *    Body weight <60 kg. Consider a lower (5-mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )] . 
 *    Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  ,  8.8  )] . 
 *    Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ,  7.2  .  7.3  ), and Clinical Studies (  14  )] . 
    Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of prasugrel's active metabolite is short relative to the lifetime of the platelet, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.
 

  Figure 1    5.2 Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery-Related Bleeding



  The risk of bleeding is increased in patients receiving Effient who undergo CABG. If possible, Effient should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to CABG.



 Of the 437 patients who underwent CABG during TRITON-TIMI 38, the rates of CABG-related TIMI Major or Minor bleeding were 14.1% in the Effient group and 4.5% in the clopidogrel group [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The higher risk for bleeding events in patients treated with Effient persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of study drug. For patients receiving a thienopyridine within 3 days prior to CABG, the frequencies of TIMI Major or Minor bleeding were 26.7% (12 of 45 patients) in the Effient group, compared with 5.0% (3 of 60 patients) in the clopidogrel group. For patients who received their last dose of thienopyridine within 4 to 7 days prior to CABG, the frequencies decreased to 11.3% (9 of 80 patients) in the prasugrel group and 3.4% (3 of 89 patients) in the clopidogrel group.



 Do not start Effient in patients likely to undergo urgent CABG. CABG-related bleeding may be treated with transfusion of blood products, including packed red blood cells and platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.



    5.3 Discontinuation of Effient



  Discontinue thienopyridines, including Effient, for active bleeding, elective surgery, stroke, or TIA. The optimal duration of thienopyridine therapy is unknown. In patients who are managed with PCI and stent placement, premature discontinuation of any antiplatelet medication, including thienopyridines, conveys an increased risk of stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Patients who require premature discontinuation of a thienopyridine will be at increased risk for cardiac events. Lapses in therapy should be avoided, and if thienopyridines must be temporarily discontinued because of an adverse event(s), they should be restarted as soon as possible [see Contraindications (  4.1  ,  4.2  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .



    5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura



  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been reported with the use of Effient. TTP can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that can be fatal and requires urgent treatment, including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragment red blood cells] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .



    5.5 Hypersensitivity Including Angioedema



  Hypersensitivity including angioedema has been reported in patients receiving Effient, including patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to other thienopyridines [see Contraindications (  4.3  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure to ENTYVIO in 3,326 patients and healthy volunteers in clinical trials, including 1,396 exposed for greater than one year, and 835 exposed for greater than two years.



 The safety data described in  Table 1  are derived from four controlled Phase 3 trials (UC Trials I and II, and CD Trials I and III); data from patients receiving open-label ENTYVIO treatment at Weeks 0 and 2 (prior to entry into UC Trial II and CD Trial III) and from Weeks 6 to 52 (non-responders at Week 6 of UC Trial I and CD Trial I) are included  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  and  14.2  )  ].



 In these trials, 1,434 patients received ENTYVIO 300 mg for up to 52 weeks, and 297 patients received placebo for up to 52 weeks. Of these, 769 patients had ulcerative colitis and 962 patients had Crohn's disease. Patients were exposed for a mean duration of 259 days (UC Trials I and II) and 247 days (CD Trials I and III).



 Adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients treated with ENTYVIO and 45% of patients treated with placebo (UC Trials I and II: 49% with ENTYVIO and 37% with placebo; CD Trials I and III: 55% with ENTYVIO and 47% with placebo). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 7% of patients treated with ENTYVIO compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo (UC Trials I and II: 8% with ENTYVIO and 7% with placebo; CD Trials I and III: 12% with ENTYVIO and 9%, with placebo).



 The most common adverse reactions (reported by >=3% of patients treated with ENTYVIO in the UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III combined group and >=1% higher than in combined placebo group) were nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, cough, bronchitis, influenza, back pain, rash, pruritus, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain and pain in extremities  (Table 1)  .

         Safety data for patients (n=279) in UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III who received ENTYVIO at Weeks 0 and 2 and were then randomized to placebo at Week 6 for up to 52 weeks, and for patients (n=416) in CD Trial II, a 10 week Crohn's disease trial, are similar to those listed in  Table 1  .
 

     Infusion-Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions    



 Serious infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported following ENTYVIO administration in clinical trials  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  . In UC Trials I and II and Crohn's Trials I and III, one case of anaphylaxis [one out of 1434 patients treated with ENTYVIO (0.07%)] was reported by a Crohn's disease patient during the second infusion (symptoms reported were dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash and increased blood pressure and heart rate) and was managed with discontinuation of infusion and treatment with antihistamine and intravenous hydrocortisone.



 In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, 4% of patients treated with ENTYVIO and 3% of patients treated with placebo experienced an infusion-related reaction (IRR). The most frequently observed IRR in the patients treated with ENTYVIO (reported more than twice) were nausea, headache, pruritus, dizziness, fatigue, infusion-related reaction, pyrexia, urticaria and vomiting (each of these adverse reactions occurred in <1% in all patients treated with ENTYVIO) and no individual adverse reaction reported occurred at a rate above 1%. These reactions generally occurred within the first two hours after the infusion and resolved with no treatment or following antihistamine and/or IV hydrocortisone treatment. Less than 1% of patients treated with ENTYVIO had IRRs assessed by the investigator as severe, and IRRs requiring discontinuation of study treatment occurred in <1%.



 In clinical trials, for patients with mild IRRs or hypersensitivity reactions, physicians were allowed to pretreat with standard medical treatment (e.g., antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or acetaminophen) prior to next infusion.



     Infections    



 In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, the rate of infections was 0.85 per patient-year in the patients treated with ENTYVIO and 0.7 per patient-year in the patients treated with placebo  [see Warnings and Precautions (    5.2    )]  . The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection. Two percent of patients discontinued ENTYVIO due to infections.



 In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, the rate of serious infections was 0.07 per patient-year in patients treated with ENTYVIO and 0.06 per patient-year in patients treated with placebo. Serious infections were more common in Crohn's disease patients than ulcerative colitis patients, and anal abscesses were the most frequently reported serious adverse reaction in Crohn's disease patients. Over 48 months, there was no increase in the rate of serious infections.



 In controlled- and open-label long-term extension trials in adults treated with ENTYVIO, serious infections have been reported, including anal abscess, sepsis (some fatal), tuberculosis, salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningitis, giardiasis and cytomegaloviral colitis.



 In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, sepsis, including bacterial sepsis and septic shock, was reported in four of 1434 (0.3%) patients treated with ENTYVIO and in two of 297 patients treated with placebo (0.7%). During these trials, two Crohn's disease patients treated with ENTYVIO died due to reported sepsis or septic shock; both of these patients had significant comorbidities and a complicated hospital course that contributed to the deaths. In an open label long-term extension trial, additional cases of sepsis (some fatal), including bacterial sepsis and septic shock, were reported. The rate of sepsis in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease receiving ENTYVIO was two per 1000 patient-years.



 In clinical trials, all patients were screened for tuberculosis. One case of latent, pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed during the controlled trials with ENTYVIO. Additional cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were diagnosed during the open-label trial. All of these observed cases occurred outside the United States, and none of the patients had extrapulmonary manifestations.



     Liver Injury    



 There have been reports of elevations of transaminase and/or bilirubin in patients receiving ENTYVIO  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  . In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, three patients reported serious adverse reactions of hepatitis, manifested as elevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin and symptoms consistent with hepatitis (e.g., malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia). These adverse reactions occurred following two to five ENTYVIO doses; however, based on case report information it is unclear if the reactions indicated drug-induced or autoimmune etiology. All patients recovered following discontinuation of therapy with some requiring corticosteroid treatment. In controlled trials, the incidence of ALT and AST elevations >=3 x ULN was <2% in patients treated with ENTYVIO and in patients treated with placebo. In the open-label trial, one additional case of serious hepatitis was observed.



     Malignancies    



 In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, malignancies (excluding dysplasia and basal cell carcinoma) were reported in six of 1434 (0.4%) patients treated with ENTYVIO, including colon cancer (n=2), transitional cell carcinoma (n=1), breast cancer (n=1), carcinoid tumor of the appendix (n=1) and squamous cell carcinoma (n=1). Malignancy was reported in one of 297 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo (squamous cell carcinoma).



 Malignancies (excluding dysplasia and basal cell carcinoma) observed during the ongoing open-label long-term extension trial included B-cell lymphoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, malignant hepatic neoplasm, malignant lung neoplasm, malignant melanoma, lung cancer of primary neuroendocrine carcinoma, renal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma. Overall, the number of malignancies in the clinical trials was small; however, long-term exposure was limited.



     Live and Oral Vaccines    



 There are no data on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ENTYVIO.



 In a placebo-controlled study of healthy volunteers, 61 subjects were given a single ENTYVIO 750 mg dose (2.5 times the recommended dose), and 62 subjects received placebo followed by intramuscular vaccination with Hepatitis B surface antigen and oral cholera vaccine. After intramuscular vaccination with three doses of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen, those treated with ENTYVIO did not have lower rates of protective immunity to Hepatitis B virus. However, those exposed to ENTYVIO did have lower seroconversion rates and anti-cholera titers relative to placebo after receiving the two doses of a killed, oral cholera vaccine. The impact on other oral vaccines and on nasal vaccines in patients is unknown.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, in patients who received ENTYVIO, the frequency of antibodies detected in patients was 13% at 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug (greater than five half-lives after last dose). During treatment, 56 of 1434 (4%) of patients treated with ENTYVIO had detectable anti-vedolizumab antibody at any time during the 52 weeks of continuous treatment. Nine of 56 patients were persistently positive (at two or more study visits) for anti-vedolizumab antibody and 33 of 56 patients developed neutralizing antibodies to vedolizumab. Among eight of these nine subjects with persistently positive anti-vedolizumab antibody and available vedolizumab concentration data, six had undetectable and two had reduced vedolizumab concentrations  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . None of the nine subjects with persistently positive anti-vedolizumab antibody achieved clinical remission at Weeks 6 or 52 in the controlled trials.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, presence of vedolizumab, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ENTYVIO with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

ENTYVIO,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Hypersensitivity Reactions (including anaphylaxis) : Discontinue ENTYVIO if anaphylaxis or other serious allergic reactions occur. (  5.1  ) 
 *     Infections : Treatment with ENTYVIO is not recommended in patients with active, severe infections until the infections are controlled. Consider withholding ENTYVIO in patients who develop a severe infection while on treatment with ENTYVIO. (  5.2  ) 
 *     Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy: Although no cases have been observed in ENTYVIO clinical trials, JCV infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death has occurred in patients treated with another integrin receptor antagonist. A risk of PML cannot be ruled out. Monitor patients for any new or worsening neurological signs or symptoms. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Infusion-Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions



  In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, hypersensitivity reactions occurred including a case of anaphylaxis (one out of 1434 patients [0.07%]) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Allergic reactions including dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash, and increased blood pressure and heart rate have also been observed. The majority were mild to moderate in severity as assessed by the investigator. Experience with other biologic medications suggests that hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis to ENTYVIO may vary in their time of onset from during infusion or immediately post-infusion to occurring up to several hours post-infusion.



 If anaphylaxis or other serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue administration of ENTYVIO immediately and initiate appropriate treatment (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines).



    5.2 Infections



  Patients treated with ENTYVIO are at increased risk for developing infections [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The most commonly reported infections in clinical trials occurring at a rate greater on ENTYVIO than placebo involved the upper respiratory and nasal mucosa (e.g., nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection). Serious infections have also been reported in patients treated with ENTYVIO, including anal abscess, sepsis (some fatal), tuberculosis, salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningitis, giardiasis and cytomegaloviral colitis.



 ENTYVIO is not recommended in patients with active, severe infections until the infections are controlled. Consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on treatment with ENTYVIO. Exercise caution when considering the use of ENTYVIO in patients with a history of recurring severe infections. Consider screening for tuberculosis (TB) according to the local practice. For progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3    ).



    5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy



  Another integrin receptor antagonist has been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection of the central nervous system (CNS). PML is caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus and typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised.



 In ENTYVIO clinical trials, patients were actively monitored for PML with frequent and regular screenings, and evaluations of any new, unexplained neurological symptoms, as necessary. While zero cases of PML were identified among patients with at least 24 months of exposure, a risk of PML cannot be ruled out. No claims of comparative safety to other integrin receptor antagonists can be made based on this data.



 Monitor patients on ENTYVIO for any new onset, or worsening, of neurological signs and symptoms. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months. If PML is suspected, withhold dosing with ENTYVIO and refer to a neurologist; if confirmed, discontinue dosing permanently.



    5.4 Liver Injury



  There have been reports of elevations of transaminase and/or bilirubin in patients receiving ENTYVIO. In general, the combination of transaminase elevations and elevated bilirubin without evidence of obstruction is generally recognized as an important predictor of severe liver injury that may lead to death or the need for a liver transplant in some patients. ENTYVIO should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or other evidence of significant liver injury [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.5 Live and Oral Vaccines



  Prior to initiating treatment with ENTYVIO, all patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations according to current immunization guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  . Patients receiving ENTYVIO may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., influenza vaccine injection) and may receive live vaccines if the benefits outweigh the risks. There are no data on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ENTYVIO [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety data described below reflect exposure to Adempas in two, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST-1) and treatment naive or pre-treated PAH patients (PATENT-1). The population (Adempas: n = 490; Placebo: n = 214) was between the age of 18 and 80 years  [See Clinical Studies (  14.1  ,  14.2  )].  



 The safety profile of Adempas in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST-1) and treatment naive or pre-treated PAH (PATENT-1) were similar. Therefore, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from the 12 and 16 week placebo-controlled trials for PAH and CTEPH respectively were pooled, and those occurring more frequently on Adempas than placebo (>=3%) are displayed in Table 1 below. Most adverse reactions in Table 1 can be ascribed to the vasodilatory mechanism of action of Adempas.



 The overall rates of discontinuation due to an adverse event in the pivotal placebo-controlled trials were 2.9% for Adempas and 5.1% for placebo (pooled data).

    Further information, including a list of certified pharmacies, is available at www.AdempasREMS.com or 1-855-4 ADEMPAS.
 

    5.3 Hypotension



  Adempas reduces blood pressure. Consider the potential for symptomatic hypotension or ischemia in patients with hypovolemia, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction, resting hypotension, autonomic dysfunction, or concomitant treatment with antihypertensives or strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (  7.2  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Consider a dose reduction if patient develops signs or symptoms of hypotension.



    5.4 Bleeding



  In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, serious bleeding occurred in 2.4% of patients taking Adempas compared to 0% of placebo patients. Serious hemoptysis occurred in 5 (1%) patients taking Adempas compared to 0 placebo patients, including one event with fatal outcome. Serious hemorrhagic events also included 2 patients with vaginal hemorrhage, 2 with catheter site hemorrhage, and 1 each with subdural hematoma, hematemesis, and intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



    5.5 Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease



  Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Therefore, administration of Adempas to such patients is not recommended. Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, the possibility of associated PVOD should be considered and, if confirmed, discontinue treatment with Adempas.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure to MOVANTIK in 1497 patients in clinical trials, including 537 patients exposed for greater than six months, and 320 patients exposed for 12 months.



 The safety data described in Table 1 are derived from two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) in patients with OIC and non-cancer related pain [  see      Clinical Studies (14)    ].



 Study 3 (n=302) was a safety extension study that allowed patients from Study 1 to continue the same blinded treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Safety data for patients in Study 3 are similar to those listed in Table 1.



 Study 4 (n=844) was a Phase 3, 52-week, multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group, safety and tolerability study of naloxegol versus usual care treatment for OIC (as determined by the investigator and excluding peripheral opioid antagonists) in patients with non-cancer related pain. The population enrolled in Study 4 was similar to that of the other studies. Eligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either naloxegol 25 mg once daily or usual care treatment for OIC. The most commonly used laxatives in the usual care group were rectal stimulants (e.g., bisacodyl), oral stimulants (e.g., senna), and oral osmotics (e.g., macrogol, magnesium). Safety data for patients in Study 4 are similar to those listed in Table 1.



 Table 1 lists adverse reactions in pooled Studies 1 and 2 occurring in >= 3% of patients receiving MOVANTIK 12.5 mg or 25 mg and at an incidence greater than placebo.

            Opioid Withdrawal  
 

 Possible opioid withdrawal, defined as at least three adverse reactions potentially related to opioid withdrawal that occurred on the same day and were not all related to the gastrointestinal system, occurred in less than 1% (1/444) of placebo subjects, 1% (5/441) receiving MOVANTIK 12.5 mg, and 3% (14/446) receiving MOVANTIK 25 mg in Studies 1 and 2 regardless of maintenance opioid treatment. Symptoms included but were not limited to hyperhidrosis, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, irritability, and yawning. Patients receiving methadone as therapy for their pain condition were observed in Studies 1 and 2 to have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving other opioids [39% (7/18) vs. 26% (110/423) in the 12.5 mg group; 75% (24/32) vs. 34% (142/414) in the 25 mg group].

MOVANTIK,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Gastrointestinal perforation : Consider the overall risk benefit in patients with known or suspected lesions of the GI tract. Monitor for severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue if development of symptoms  (5.1)   
 *     Opioid withdrawal : Consider the overall risk benefit in patients with disruptions to the blood-brain barrier. Monitor for symptoms of opioid withdrawal  (5.2)   
    
 

   5.1 Gastrointestinal Perforation



  Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported with use of another peripherally acting opioid antagonist in patients with conditions that may be associated with localized or diffuse reduction of structural integrity in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., peptic ulcer disease, Ogilvie's syndrome, diverticular disease, infiltrative gastrointestinal tract malignancies or peritoneal metastases). Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using MOVANTIK in patients with these conditions or other conditions which might result in impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g., Crohn's disease). Monitor for the development of severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue MOVANTIK in patients who develop this symptom [ see     Contraindications (4)    ].



    5.2 Opioid Withdrawal



  Clusters of symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including hyperhidrosis, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, irritability, and yawning have occurred in patients treated with MOVANTIK [ see     Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. In addition, patients receiving methadone as therapy for their pain condition were observed in clinical trials to have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions that may have been related to opioid withdrawal than patients receiving other opioids [ see     Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Patients having disruptions to the blood-brain barrier may be at increased risk for opioid withdrawal or reduced analgesia. Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using MOVANTIK in such patients. Monitor for symptoms of opioid withdrawal in such patients.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Colorectal Cancer  



 The safety data described below, except where noted, are derived from a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 1) in which 500 patients (median age 61 years; 61% men) with previously-treated metastatic colorectal cancer received Stivarga as a single agent at the dose of 160 mg daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week treatment cycle and 253 patients (median age 61 years; 60% men) received placebo. The median duration of therapy was 7.3 (range 0.3, 47.0) weeks for patients receiving Stivarga. Due to adverse reactions, 61% of the patients receiving Stivarga required a dose interruption and 38% of the patients had their dose reduced. Drug-related adverse reactions that resulted in treatment discontinuation were reported in 8.2% of Stivarga-treated patients compared to 1.2% of patients who received placebo. Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and rash were the most common reasons for permanent discontinuation of Stivarga.



   Table 1  compares the incidence of adverse reactions (>=10%) in patients receiving Stivarga and reported more commonly than in patients receiving placebo (Study 1).

 The safety data described below are derived from a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2) in which 132 patients (median age 60 years; 64% men) with previously-treated GIST received Stivarga as a single agent at a dose of 160 mg daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week treatment cycle and 66 patients (median age 61 years; 64% men) received placebo. The median duration of therapy was 22.9 (range 0.1, 50.9) weeks for patients receiving Stivarga. Dose interruptions for adverse events were required in 58% of patients receiving Stivarga and 50% of patients had their dose reduced. Drug-related adverse reactions that resulted in treatment discontinuation were reported in 2.3% of Stivarga-treated patients compared to 1.5% of patients who received placebo.



   Table 3  compares the incidence of adverse reactions (>=10%) in GIST patients receiving Stivarga and reported more commonly than in patients receiving placebo (Study 2).

   5.1 Hepatotoxicity



  Severe drug induced liver injury with fatal outcome occurred in 0.3% of 1200 Stivarga-treated patients across all clinical trials. Liver biopsy results, when available, showed hepatocyte necrosis with lymphocyte infiltration. In Study 1, fatal hepatic failure occurred in 1.6% of patients in the regorafenib arm and in 0.4% of patients in the placebo arm; all the patients with hepatic failure had metastatic disease in the liver. In Study 2, fatal hepatic failure occurred in 0.8% of patients in the regorafenib arm [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 Obtain liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before initiation of Stivarga and monitor at least every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment. Thereafter, monitor monthly or more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor liver function tests weekly in patients experiencing elevated liver function tests until improvement to less than 3 times the ULN or baseline.



 Temporarily hold and then reduce or permanently discontinue Stivarga depending on the severity and persistence of hepatotoxicity as manifested by elevated liver function tests or hepatocellular necrosis [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



    5.2 Hemorrhage



  Stivarga caused an increased incidence of hemorrhage. The overall incidence (Grades 1-5) was 21% and 11% in Stivarga-treated patients compared to 8% and 3% in placebo-treated patients in Studies 1 and 2. Fatal hemorrhage occurred in 4 of 632 (0.6%) of Stivarga-treated patients in Studies 1 and 2 and involved the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts.



 Permanently discontinue Stivarga in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage. Monitor INR levels more frequently in patients receiving warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



    5.3 Dermatological Toxicity



  Stivarga caused increased incidences of adverse reactions involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues (72% versus 24% in Study 1 and 78% versus 24% in Study 2), including hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), and severe rash requiring dose modification.



 The overall incidence of HFSR was higher in Stivarga-treated patients, (45% versus 7% in Study 1 and 67% versus 12% in Study 2), than in the placebo-treated patients. Most cases of HFSR in Stivarga-treated patients appeared during the first cycle of treatment (69% and 71% of patients who developed HFSR in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively). The incidence of Grade 3 HFSR (17% versus 0% in Study 1 and 22% versus 0% in Study 2), Grade 3 rash (6% versus <1% in Study 1 and 7% versus 0% in Study 2), serious adverse reactions of erythema multiforme (0.2% vs. 0% in Study 1) and Stevens Johnson Syndrome (0.2% vs. 0% in Study 1) was higher in Stivarga-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 Toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in 0.17% of 1200 Stivarga-treated patients across all clinical trials.



 Withhold Stivarga, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue Stivarga depending on the severity and persistence of dermatologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  . Institute supportive measures for symptomatic relief.



    5.4 Hypertension



  Stivarga caused an increased incidence of hypertension (30% versus 8% in Study 1 and 59% versus 27% in Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Hypertensive crisis occurred in 0.25% of 1200 Stivarga-treated patients across all clinical trials. The onset of hypertension occurred during the first cycle of treatment in most patients who developed hypertension (72% in Study 1 and Study 2).



 Do not initiate Stivarga unless blood pressure is adequately controlled. Monitor blood pressure weekly for the first 6 weeks of treatment and then every cycle, or more frequently, as clinically indicated. Temporarily or permanently withhold Stivarga for severe or uncontrolled hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



    5.5 Cardiac Ischemia and Infarction



  Stivarga increased the incidence of myocardial ischemia and infarction in Study 1 (1.2% versus 0.4%) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Withhold Stivarga in patients who develop new or acute onset cardiac ischemia or infarction. Resume Stivarga only after resolution of acute cardiac ischemic events, if the potential benefits outweigh the risks of further cardiac ischemia.



    5.6 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)



  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic finding on MRI, occurred in one of 1200 Stivarga-treated patients across all clinical trials. Perform an evaluation for RPLS in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Discontinue Stivarga in patients who develop RPLS.



    5.7 Gastrointestinal Perforation or Fistula



  Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in 0.6% of 1200 patients treated with Stivarga across all clinical trials; this included four fatal events. In Study 2, 2.1% (4/188) of Stivarga-treated patients who were treated during the blinded or open-label portion of the study developed gastrointestinal fistula or perforation; of these, two cases of gastrointestinal perforation were fatal. Permanently discontinue Stivarga in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation or fistula.



    5.8 Wound Healing Complications



  No formal studies of the effect of regorafenib on wound healing have been conducted. Since vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors such as regorafenib can impair wound healing, treatment with regorafenib should be stopped at least 2 weeks prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume regorafenib after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Regorafenib should be discontinued in patients with wound dehiscence.



    5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Stivarga can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The clinical program for ANORO ELLIPTA included 8,138 subjects with COPD in four 6-month lung function trials, one 12-month long-term safety study, and 9 other trials of shorter duration. A total of 1,124 subjects have received at least 1 dose of ANORO ELLIPTA (umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5 mcg/25 mcg), and 1,330 subjects have received a higher dose of umeclidinium/vilanterol (125 mcg/25 mcg). The safety data described below are based on the four 6-month and the one 12-month trials. Adverse reactions observed in the other trials were similar to those observed in the confirmatory trials.



   6-Month Trials:  The incidence of adverse reactions associated with ANORO ELLIPTA in Table 1 is based on four 6-month trials: 2 placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2; n = 1,532 and n = 1,489, respectively) and 2 active-controlled trials (Trials 3 and 4; n = 843 and n = 869, respectively). Of the 4,733 subjects, 68% were male and 84% were Caucasian. They had a mean age of 63 years and an average smoking history of 45 pack-years, with 50% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 48% (range: 13% to 76%), the mean post-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 0.47 (range: 0.13 to 0.78), and the mean percent reversibility was 14% (range: -45% to 109%).



 Subjects received 1 dose once daily of the following: ANORO ELLIPTA, umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 mcg/25 mcg, umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, umeclidinium 125 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, active control, or placebo.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ASTHMA-RELATED DEATH

  WARNING: ASTHMA-RELATED DEATH

    Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) increase the risk of asthma-related death. Data from a large placebo-controlled US trial that compared the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo added to usual asthma therapy showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol. This finding with salmeterol is considered a class effect of all LABA, including vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in ANOROTM ELLIPTA  (r)     [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .  



   The safety and efficacy of ANORO ELLIPTA in patients with asthma have not been established. ANORO ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: ASTHMA-RELATED DEATH



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA), such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in ANORO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. A placebo-controlled trial with another LABA (salmeterol) showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol. This finding with salmeterol is considered a class effect of all LABA, including vilanterol. (5.1)

   EXCERPT:    *    LABA increase the risk of asthma-related death. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or to treat acute symptoms. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Do not use in combination with an additional medicine containing LABA because of risk of overdose. (  5.3  ) 
 *    If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue ANORO ELLIPTA and institute alternative therapy. (  5.5  )

   5.1 Asthma-Related Death



    *    Data from a large placebo-controlled trial in subjects with asthma showed that LABA may increase the risk of asthma-related death. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by LABA. 
 *    A 28-week, placebo-controlled, US trial comparing the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA, including vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in ANORO ELLIPTA. 
 *    No trial adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in subjects treated with ANORO ELLIPTA has been conducted. The safety and efficacy of ANORO ELLIPTA in patients with asthma have not been established. ANORO ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment of asthma. 
       5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes
 

  ANORO ELLIPTA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of COPD. ANORO ELLIPTA has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating COPD. The initiation of ANORO ELLIPTA in this setting is not appropriate.



 ANORO ELLIPTA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. ANORO ELLIPTA has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist.



 When beginning treatment with ANORO ELLIPTA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and to use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing ANORO ELLIPTA, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.



 COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If ANORO ELLIPTA no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction; the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective; or the patient needs more short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dose of ANORO ELLIPTA beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation.



    5.3 Excessive Use of ANORO ELLIPTA and Use With Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists



  ANORO ELLIPTA should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using ANORO ELLIPTA should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.



    5.4 Drug Interactions With Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors



  Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of ANORO ELLIPTA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) because increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .



    5.5 Paradoxical Bronchospasm



  As with other inhaled medicines, ANORO ELLIPTA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with ANORO ELLIPTA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; ANORO ELLIPTA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted.



    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of ANORO ELLIPTA. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use ANORO ELLIPTA [see Contraindications (4)]  .



    5.7 Cardiovascular Effects



  Vilanterol, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  . If such effects occur, ANORO ELLIPTA may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown.



 Therefore, ANORO ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.



    5.8 Coexisting Conditions



  ANORO ELLIPTA, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.



    5.9 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma



  ANORO ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develops.



    5.10 Worsening of Urinary Retention



  ANORO ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develops .  



    5.11 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia



  Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Beta-agonist medicines may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients. In 4 clinical trials of 6-month duration evaluating ANORO ELLIPTA in subjects with COPD, there was no evidence of a treatment effect on serum glucose or potassium.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In the premarketing development of adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures, 1327 patients received VIMPAT in controlled and uncontrolled trials, of whom 1000 were treated for longer than 6 months, and 852 for longer than 12 months. The monotherapy development program included 425 patients, 310 of whom were treated for longer than 6 months, and 254 for longer than 12 months.

     Monotherapy Historical-Control Trial (Study 1)  



 *     In the monotherapy trial, 16% of patients randomized to receive VIMPAT at the recommended doses of 300 and 400 mg/day discontinued from the trial as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reaction most commonly (>=1% on VIMPAT) leading to discontinuation was dizziness. 
   *     Adverse reactions that occurred in this study were generally similar to those that occurred in adjunctive placebo-controlled studies. One adverse reaction, insomnia, occurred at a rate of >=2% and was not reported at a similar rate in previous studies. This adverse reaction has also been observed in postmarketing experience [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)   ]. Because this study did not include a placebo control group, causality could not be established. 
   *     Dizziness, headache, nausea, somnolence, and fatigue all occurred at lower incidences during the AED Withdrawal Phase and Monotherapy Phase, compared with the Titration Phase [ see  Clinical Studies (14.1)   ]. 
        Adjunctive Therapy Controlled Trials (Studies 2, 3, and 4)  
 

 *     In adjunctive therapy controlled clinical trials, the rate of discontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 8% and 17% in patients randomized to receive VIMPAT at the recommended doses of 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively, 29% at 600 mg/day, and 5% in patients randomized to receive placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly (>1% on VIMPAT and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, diplopia, nausea, vertigo, and blurred vision. 
   *     Table 2 gives the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in >=2% of adult patients with partial-onset seizures in the VIMPAT total group and for which the incidence was greater than placebo.

            The overall adverse reaction rate was similar in male and female patients. Although there were few non-Caucasian patients, no differences in the incidences of adverse events compared to Caucasian patients were observed.
 

     Laboratory Abnormalities  



 *     Abnormalities in liver function tests have occurred in controlled trials with VIMPAT in adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1 to 3 concomitant anti-epileptic drugs. Elevations of ALT to >=3* ULN occurred in 0.7% (7/935) of VIMPAT patients and 0% (0/356) of placebo patients . One case of hepatitis with transaminases >20* ULN occurred in one healthy subject 10 days after VIMPAT treatment completion, along with nephritis (proteinuria and urine casts). Serologic studies were negative for viral hepatitis. Transaminases returned to normal within one month without specific treatment. At the time of this event, bilirubin was normal. The hepatitis/nephritis was interpreted as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to VIMPAT. 
        Other Adverse Reactions  
 

 *     The following is a list of adverse reactions reported by patients treated with VIMPAT in all clinical trials in patients with partial-onset seizures, including controlled trials and long-term open-label extension trials. Adverse reactions addressed in other tables or sections are not listed here. 
   *     Blood and lymphatic system disorders: neutropenia, anemia 
   *     Cardiac disorders: palpitations 
   *     Ear and labyrinth disorders: tinnitus 
   *     Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, dyspepsia, dry mouth, oral hypoaesthesia 
   *     General disorders and administration site conditions: irritability, pyrexia, feeling drunk 
   *     Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications: fall 
   *     Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms 
   *     Nervous system disorders: paresthesia, cognitive disorder, hypoaesthesia, dysarthria, disturbance in attention, cerebellar syndrome 
   *     Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, mood altered, depressed mood 
        VIMPAT Injection  
 

 Adverse reactions with intravenous administration generally were similar to those that occurred with the oral formulation, although intravenous administration was associated with local adverse reactions such as injection site pain or discomfort (2.5%), irritation (1%), and erythema (0.5%). One case of profound bradycardia (26 bpm: BP 100/60 mmHg) occurred in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg VIMPAT. This patient was on a beta-blocker. Infusion was discontinued and the patient experienced a rapid recovery.



 The safety of a 15-minute loading dose administration of VIMPAT Injection 200 mg to 400 mg followed by oral administration of VIMPAT given twice daily at the same total daily dose as the initial intravenous infusion was assessed in an open-label study in patients with partial-onset seizures. Patients had to have been maintained on a stable dose regimen of 1 to 2 marketed antiepileptics for at least 28 days prior to treatment assignment. Treatment groups were as follows:



 *  Single dose of intravenous VIMPAT Injection 200 mg followed by oral VIMPAT 200 mg/day (100 mg every 12 hours) 
 *  Single dose of intravenous VIMPAT Injection 300 mg followed by oral VIMPAT 300 mg/day (150 mg every 12 hours) 
 *  Single dose of intravenous VIMPAT Injection 400 mg followed by oral VIMPAT 400 mg/day (200 mg every 12 hours). 
    Table 3 gives the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in >=5% of adult patients in any VIMPAT dosing group.

           Adverse reactions that occurred with infusion of VIMPAT 200 mg over 15-minutes followed by VIMPAT 100 mg administered orally twice per day were similar in frequency to those that occurred in 3-month adjunctive therapy controlled trials. Considering the difference in period of observations (1 week vs. 3 months), the incidence of CNS adverse reactions, such as dizziness, somnolence, and paresthesia may be higher with 15-minute administration of VIMPAT Injection than with administration over a 30-to 60-minute period.
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIMPAT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   EXCERPT:    *  Monitor patients for suicidal behavior and ideation (  5.1  ) 
 *  VIMPAT may cause dizziness and ataxia (  5.2  ) 
 *  Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities: ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose is recommended in patients with known cardiac conduction problems, taking drugs known to induce PR interval prolongation, or with severe cardiac disease (  5.3  ) 
 *  VIMPAT may cause syncope (  5.4  ) 
 *  VIMPAT should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency (  5.5  ) 
 *  Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation



  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including VIMPAT, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.



 Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.



 The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.



 The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.



 Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar.
 

 Anyone considering prescribing VIMPAT or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which antiepileptics are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.



 Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.



    5.2 Dizziness and Ataxia



  VIMPAT may cause dizziness and ataxia.



 In patients with partial-onset seizures taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs, dizziness was experienced by 25% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of VIMPAT (compared with 8% of placebo patients) and was the adverse event most frequently leading to discontinuation (3%). Ataxia was experienced by 6% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of VIMPAT (compared to 2% of placebo patients). The onset of dizziness and ataxia was most commonly observed during titration. There was a substantial increase in these adverse events at doses higher than 400 mg/day [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].



    5.3 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities



   PR interval prolongation  



 Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with VIMPAT have been observed in clinical studies in patients and in healthy volunteers [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ]. In adjunctive clinical trials in patients with partial-onset epilepsy, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive VIMPAT and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. In clinical trials in patients with diabetic neuropathy, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.5% (5/1023) of patients receiving VIMPAT and 0% (0/291) of patients receiving placebo. Second degree and complete AV block have been reported in patients in pain studies and in patients with seizures. When VIMPAT is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible.



  VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), sodium channelopathies (e.g., Brugada Syndrome), on concomitant medications that prolong PR interval, or with severe cardiac disease such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered VIMPAT through the intravenous route. One case of profound bradycardia was observed in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg VIMPAT. There were two postmarketing reports of third degree AV block in patients with significant cardiac history and also receiving metoprolol and amlodipine during infusion of VIMPAT injection at doses higher than recommended [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].    



    Atrial fibrillation and Atrial flutter  



 In the short-term investigational trials of VIMPAT in epilepsy patients, there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label epilepsy trials and in postmarketing experience. In patients with diabetic neuropathy, 0.5% of patients treated with VIMPAT experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. VIMPAT administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.



    5.4 Syncope



   In the short-term controlled trials of VIMPAT in epilepsy patients with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials of VIMPAT in patients with diabetic neuropathy, 1.2% of patients who were treated with VIMPAT reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical epilepsy studies. These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.  



    5.5 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)



  As with all AEDs, VIMPAT should be withdrawn gradually (over a minimum of 1 week) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.



    5.6 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions



  One case of symptomatic hepatitis and nephritis was observed among 4011 subjects exposed to VIMPAT during clinical development. The event occurred in a healthy volunteer, 10 days after stopping VIMPAT treatment. The subject was not taking any concomitant medication and potential known viral etiologies for hepatitis were ruled out. The subject fully recovered within a month, without specific treatment. The case is consistent with a delayed multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction. Additional potential cases included 2 with rash and elevated liver enzymes and 1 with myocarditis and hepatitis of uncertain etiology.



 Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as D  rug R  eaction with E  osinophilia and S  ystemic S  ymptoms, or DRESS) have been reported with other antiepileptics and typically, although not exclusively, present with fever and rash associated with other organ system involvement, that may or may not include eosinophilia, hepatitis, nephritis, lymphadenopathy, and/or myocarditis. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system signs and symptoms not noted here may occur. If this reaction is suspected, VIMPAT should be discontinued and alternative treatment started.



    5.7 Phenylketonurics



  VIMPAT oral solution contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. A 200 mg dose of VIMPAT oral solution (equivalent to 20 mL) contains 0.32 mg of phenylalanine.

    6.1         Clinical    Trials    Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Adverse Reactions in    Adult and Pediatric Patients ages    3    to 17 years of age  



 In the pooled, double-blind, adjunctive therapy studies in adult and pediatric patients ages 3 to 17 years of age, the most common (>=10%) adverse reactions in BANZEL-treated patients, in all doses studied (200 to 3200 mg per day) with a higher frequency than in patients on placebo were: headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, and nausea.



 Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of pediatric patients (ages 3 to less than 17 years) with epilepsy treated with BANZEL in controlled adjunctive studies and were numerically more common in patients treated with BANZEL than in patients on placebo.



 At the target dose of 45 mg/kg per day for adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (ages 3 to less than 17 years), the most common (>=3%) adverse reactions with an incidence greater than in placebo for BANZEL were somnolence, vomiting, and headache.

 In controlled, double-blind, adjunctive clinical studies, 9% of pediatric and adult patients receiving BANZEL as adjunctive therapy and 4% receiving placebo discontinued as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly leading to discontinuation of BANZEL (>1%) used as adjunctive therapy were generally similar in adults and pediatric patients.



 In pediatric patients (ages 4 to less than 17 years) double-blind adjunctive clinical studies, 8% of patients receiving BANZEL as adjunctive therapy (at the recommended dose of 45 mg/kg per day) and 2% receiving placebo discontinued as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly leading to discontinuation of BANZEL (>1%) used as adjunctive therapy are presented in Table 4.

 In a multicenter, parallel group, open-label study comparing BANZEL (45 mg/kg per day) adjunctive treatment (n=25) to the adjunctive treatment with an AED of the investigator's choice (n=11) in pediatric patients (1 year to less than 4 years of age) with inadequately controlled Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, the adverse reaction profile was generally similar to that observed in adults and pediatric patients 4 years of age and older treated with BANZEL. Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 (8 %) BANZEL-treated patients and with a higher frequency than in the AED comparator group were: vomiting (24%), somnolence (16%), bronchitis (12%), constipation (12%), cough (12%), decreased appetite (12%), rash (12%), otitis media (8%), pneumonia (8%), decreased weight (8%), gastroenteritis (8%), nasal congestion (8%), and pneumonia aspiration (8%).  



   Other Adverse    Reactions    Observed During Clinical Trials  



 BANZEL has been administered to 1978 individuals during all epilepsy clinical trials (placebo-controlled and open-label). Adverse reactions occurring during these studies were recorded by the investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of patients having adverse reactions, these events were grouped into standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary. Adverse events occurring at least three times and considered possibly related to treatment are included in the System Organ Class listings below. Terms not included in the listings are those already included in the tables above, those too general to be informative, those related to procedures, and terms describing events common in the population. Some events occurring fewer than 3 times are also included based on their medical significance. Because the reports include events observed in open-label, uncontrolled observations, the role of BANZEL in their causation cannot be reliably determined.



 Events are classified by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency as follows:  frequent adverse events  -those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events-those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients;  rare  -those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.



 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:  Frequent:  anemia.  Infrequent:  lymphadenopathy, leukopenia, neutropenia, iron deficiency anemia, thrombocytopenia.



 Cardiac Disorders:  Infrequent:  bundle branch block right, atrioventricular block first degree.



 Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders:  Frequent:  decreased appetite, increased appetite.



 Renal and Urinary Disorders:  Frequent:  pollakiuria.  Infrequent:  urinary incontinence, dysuria, hematuria, nephrolithiasis, polyuria, enuresis, nocturia, incontinence.



     6.2         Post    m    arketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of BANZEL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    5.1        Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  



  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including BANZEL, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.



 Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.



 The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.



 The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.
 

 Anyone considering prescribing BANZEL or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.



 Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.



     5.2        C   entral Nervous System Reactions  



  Use of BANZEL has been associated with central nervous system-related adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial of patients 4 years or older with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The most significant of these can be classified into two general categories: 1) somnolence or fatigue, and 2) coordination abnormalities, dizziness, gait disturbances, and ataxia.



 Somnolence was reported in 24% of BANZEL-treated patients compared to 13% of patients on placebo, and led to study discontinuation in 3% of BANZEL-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo. Fatigue was reported in 10% of BANZEL-treated patients compared to 8% of patients on placebo patients. It led to study discontinuation in 1% of BANZEL-treated patients and 0% of patients on placebo patients.



 Dizziness was reported in 2.7% of BANZEL-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo, and did not lead to study discontinuation.



 Ataxia and gait disturbance were reported in 5.4% and 1.4% of BANZEL-treated patients, respectively, compared to no patient on placebo. None of these reactions led to study discontinuation.



 Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on BANZEL to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.



     5.3        QT Shortening  



  Formal cardiac ECG studies demonstrated shortening of the QT interval (mean = 20 msec, for doses >  2400 mg twice daily) with BANZEL. In a placebo-controlled study of the QT interval, a higher percentage of BANZEL-treated subjects (46% at 2400 mg, 46% at 3200 mg, and 65% at 4800 mg) had a QT shortening of greater than 20 msec at Tmaxcompared to placebo (5-10%). 



 Reductions of the QT interval below 300 msec were not observed in the formal QT studies with doses up to 7200 mg per day. Moreover, there was no signal for drug-induced sudden death or ventricular arrhythmias.



 The degree of QT shortening induced by BANZEL is without any known clinical risk.  Familial Short QT syndrome is associated with an increased risk of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation.  Such events in this syndrome are believed to occur primarily when the corrected QT interval falls below 300 msec. Non-clinical data also indicate that QT shortening is associated with ventricular fibrillation.



 Patients with Familial Short QT syndrome should not be treated with BANZEL. Caution should be used when administering BANZEL with other drugs that shorten the QT interval [ see   Contraindications   (     4     )  ]. 



     5.4        Multi-organ Hypersensitivity   /Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  



  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including BANZEL.  DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident.  Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. 



 All cases of DRESS identified in clinical trials with BANZEL occurred in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, and resolved or improved with BANZEL discontinuation. DRESS has also been reported in adult and pediatric patients taking BANZEL in the postmarketing setting.



 If DRESS is suspected, the patient should be evaluated immediately, BANZEL should be discontinued, and alternative treatment should be started.



     5.5        Withdrawal of AEDs  



  As with all antiepileptic drugs, BANZEL should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus. If abrupt discontinuation of the drug is medically necessary, the transition to another AED should be made under close medical supervision. In clinical trials, BANZEL discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every 2 days.



     5.6        Status Epilepticus  



  Estimates of the incidence of treatment emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with BANZEL are difficult because standard definitions were not employed. In a controlled Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome trial, 3 of 74 (4.1%) BANZEL-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus in the BANZEL-treated patients compared with none of the 64 patients in the placebo-treated patients. In all controlled trials that included patients with different epilepsies, 11 of 1240 (0.9%) BANZEL-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus compared with none of 635 patients in the placebo-treated patients.



     5.7        Leukopenia  



  BANZEL has been shown to reduce white cell count. Leukopenia (white cell count < 3X10  9  L) was more commonly observed in BANZEL-treated patients 43 of 1171 (3.7%) than placebo-treated patients, 7 of 579 (1.2%) in all controlled trials.

XELJANZ,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  EXCERPT:   The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3 months in controlled clinical trials (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with XELJANZ monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, headache, diarrhea and nasopharyngitis. (  6.1  )  To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer, Inc at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice.



 Although other doses have been studied, the recommended dose of XELJANZ is 5 mg twice daily.



 The following data includes two Phase 2 and five Phase 3 double-blind, controlled, multicenter trials. In these trials, patients were randomized to doses of XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily (292 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (306 patients) monotherapy, XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily (1044 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (1043 patients) in combination with DMARDs (including methotrexate) and placebo (809 patients). All seven protocols included provisions for patients taking placebo to receive treatment with XELJANZ at Month 3 or Month 6 either by patient response (based on uncontrolled disease activity) or by design, so that adverse events cannot always be unambiguously attributed to a given treatment. Therefore some analyses that follow include patients who changed treatment by design or by patient response from placebo to XELJANZ in both the placebo and XELJANZ group of a given interval. Comparisons between placebo and XELJANZ were based on the first 3 months of exposure, and comparisons between XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily were based on the first 12 months of exposure.



 The long-term safety population includes all patients who participated in a double-blind, controlled trial (including earlier development phase studies) and then participated in one of two long-term safety studies. The design of the long-term safety studies allowed for modification of XELJANZ doses according to clinical judgment. This limits the interpretation of the long-term safety data with respect to dose.



 The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



 The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the 0 to 3 months exposure in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was 4% for patients taking XELJANZ and 3% for placebo-treated patients.



     Overall Infections  



 In the seven controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, the overall frequency of infections was 20% and 22% in the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily groups, respectively, and 18% in the placebo group.



 The most commonly reported infections with XELJANZ were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infections (4%, 3%, and 2% of patients, respectively).



     Serious Infections  



 In the seven controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, serious infections were reported in 1 patient (0.5 events per 100 patient-years) who received placebo and 11 patients (1.7 events per 100 patient-years) who received XELJANZ 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. The rate difference between treatment groups (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 1.1 (-0.4, 2.5) events per 100 patient-years for the combined 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ group minus placebo.



 In the seven controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, serious infections were reported in 34 patients (2.7 events per 100 patient-years) who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 33 patients (2.7 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was -0.1 (-1.3, 1.2) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ.



 The most common serious infections included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



     Tuberculosis  



 In the seven controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, tuberculosis was not reported in patients who received placebo, 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ, or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ.



 In the seven controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, tuberculosis was reported in 0 patients who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 6 patients (0.5 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0.5 (0.1, 0.9) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ.



 Cases of disseminated tuberculosis were also reported. The median XELJANZ exposure prior to diagnosis of tuberculosis was 10 months (range from 152 to 960 days) [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  



     Opportunistic Infections (excluding tuberculosis)  



 In the seven controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, opportunistic infections were not reported in patients who received placebo, 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ, or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ.



 In the seven controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, opportunistic infections were reported in 4 patients (0.3 events per 100 patient-years) who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 4 patients (0.3 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0 (-0.5, 0.5) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ.



 The median XELJANZ exposure prior to diagnosis of an opportunistic infection was 8 months (range from 41 to 698 days)  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  



     Malignancy  



 In the seven controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, malignancies excluding NMSC were reported in 0 patients who received placebo and 2 patients (0.3 events per 100 patient-years) who received either XELJANZ 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. The rate difference between treatment groups (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0.3 (-0.1, 0.7) events per 100 patient-years for the combined 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ group minus placebo.



 In the seven controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, malignancies excluding NMSC were reported in 5 patients (0.4 events per 100 patient-years) who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 7 patients (0.6 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0.2 (-0.4, 0.7) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ. One of these malignancies was a case of lymphoma that occurred during the 0 to 12 month period in a patient treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily.



 The most common types of malignancy, including malignancies observed during the long-term extension, were lung and breast cancer, followed by gastric, colorectal, renal cell, prostate cancer, lymphoma, and malignant melanoma  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



     Lymphopenia  



 In the controlled clinical trials, confirmed decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts below 500 cells/mm  3  occurred in 0.04% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ groups combined during the first 3 months of exposure.



 Confirmed lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/mm  3  were associated with an increased incidence of treated and serious infections  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ].  



     Neutropenia  



 In the controlled clinical trials, confirmed decreases in ANC below 1000 cells/mm  3  occurred in 0.07% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ groups combined during the first 3 months of exposure.



 There were no confirmed decreases in ANC below 500 cells/mm  3  observed in any treatment group.



 There was no clear relationship between neutropenia and the occurrence of serious infections.



 In the long-term safety population, the pattern and incidence of confirmed decreases in ANC remained consistent with what was seen in the controlled clinical trials  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ].  



     Liver Enzyme Elevations  



 Confirmed increases in liver enzymes greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (3* ULN) were observed in patients treated with XELJANZ. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of XELJANZ, or reduction in XELJANZ dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes.



 In the controlled monotherapy trials (0-3 months), no differences in the incidence of ALT or AST elevations were observed between the placebo, and XELJANZ 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily groups.



 In the controlled background DMARD trials (0-3 months), ALT elevations greater than 3* ULN were observed in 1.0%, 1.3% and 1.2% of patients receiving placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. In these trials, AST elevations greater than 3* ULN were observed in 0.6%, 0.5% and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively.



 One case of drug-induced liver injury was reported in a patient treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily for approximately 2.5 months. The patient developed symptomatic elevations of AST and ALT greater than 3* ULN and bilirubin elevations greater than 2* ULN, which required hospitalizations and a liver biopsy.



     Lipid Elevations  



 In the controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) were observed at one month of exposure and remained stable thereafter. Changes in lipid parameters during the first 3 months of exposure in the controlled clinical trials are summarized below:



 *  Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 15% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily arm and 19% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily arm. 
 *  Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 10% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily arm and 12% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily arm. 
 *  Mean LDL/HDL ratios were essentially unchanged in XELJANZ-treated patients. 
    In a controlled clinical trial, elevations in LDL cholesterol and ApoB decreased to pretreatment levels in response to statin therapy.
 

 In the long-term safety population, elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the controlled clinical trials.



     Serum Creatinine Elevations  



 In the controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in serum creatinine were observed with XELJANZ treatment. The mean increase in serum creatinine was <0.1 mg/dL in the 12-month pooled safety analysis; however with increasing duration of exposure in the long-term extensions, up to 2% of patients were discontinued from XELJANZ treatment due to the protocol-specified discontinuation criterion of an increase in creatinine by more than 50% of baseline. The clinical significance of the observed serum creatinine elevations is unknown.



     Other Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on 5 mg twice daily or 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ and at least 1% greater than that observed in patients on placebo with or without DMARD are summarized in Table 4.

    SERIOUS INFECTIONS  



   Patients treated with XELJANZ are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   and   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.  



   If a serious infection develops, interrupt XELJANZ until the infection is controlled.   



   Reported infections include:   



 *  Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before XELJANZ use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to XELJANZ use. 
 *  Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. 
 *  Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens. 
      The risks and benefits of treatment with XELJANZ should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.   
 

   Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



     MALIGNANCIES

   5.1 Serious Infections



   Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving XELJANZ. The most common serious infections reported with XELJANZ included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract infection, and diverticulitis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections, cryptococcosis, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with XELJANZ. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.  



 Other serious infections that were not reported in clinical studies may also occur (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and listeriosis).



 Avoid use of XELJANZ in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ in patients:



 *  with chronic or recurrent infection 
 *  who have been exposed to tuberculosis 
 *  with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection 
 *  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or 
 *  with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. 
    Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ. XELJANZ should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with XELJANZ should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored.
 

    Tuberculosis  



 Patients should be evaluated and tested for latent or active infection prior to administration of XELJANZ.



 Anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to administration of XELJANZ in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but who have risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.



 Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.



 Patients with latent tuberculosis should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before administering XELJANZ.



    Viral Reactivation  



  Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. The impact of XELJANZ on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients who screened positive for hepatitis B or C were excluded from clinical trials. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with XELJANZ. The risk of herpes zoster is increased in patients treated with XELJANZ and appears to be higher in patients treated with XELJANZ in Japan.  



    5.2 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders



  Consider the risks and benefits of XELJANZ treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing XELJANZ in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies were observed in clinical studies of XELJANZ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 In the seven controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, 11 solid cancers and one lymphoma were diagnosed in 3328 patients receiving XELJANZ with or without DMARD, compared to 0 solid cancers and 0 lymphomas in 809 patients in the placebo with or without DMARD group during the first 12 months of exposure. Lymphomas and solid cancers have also been observed in the long-term extension studies in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with XELJANZ.



 In Phase 2B, controlled dose-ranging trials in de-novo  renal transplant patients, all of whom received induction therapy with basiliximab, high-dose corticosteroids, and mycophenolic acid products, Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder was observed in 5 out of 218 patients treated with XELJANZ (2.3%) compared to 0 out of 111 patients treated with cyclosporine.



    Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer  



 Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.



    5.3 Gastrointestinal Perforations



  Events of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical studies with XELJANZ in rheumatoid arthritis patients, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known.



 XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms should be evaluated promptly for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities



   Lymphocyte Abnormalities  



 Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with initial lymphocytosis at one month of exposure followed by a gradual decrease in mean absolute lymphocyte counts below the baseline of approximately 10% during 12 months of therapy. Lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/mm  3  were associated with an increased incidence of treated and serious infections.



 Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a low lymphocyte count (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm  3  ). In patients who develop a confirmed absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells/mm  3  treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended.



 Monitor lymphocyte counts at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on lymphocyte counts see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    .



    Neutropenia  



 Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than 2000 cells/mm  3  ) compared to placebo.



 Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count (i.e., ANC less than 1000 cells/mm  3  ). For patients who develop a persistent ANC of 500-1000 cells/mm  3  , interrupt XELJANZ dosing until ANC is greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm  3  . In patients who develop an ANC less than 500 cells/mm  3  , treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended.



 Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on ANC results see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    .



    Anemia  



 Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a low hemoglobin level (i.e. less than 9 g/dL). Treatment with XELJANZ should be interrupted in patients who develop hemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dL or whose hemoglobin level drops greater than 2 g/dL on treatment.



 Monitor hemoglobin at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on hemoglobin results see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    .



    Liver Enzyme Elevations  



 Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily methotrexate) therapy.



 Routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of the causes of liver enzyme elevations is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of XELJANZ should be interrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded.



    Lipid Elevations  



 Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with increases in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.



 Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 4-8 weeks following initiation of XELJANZ therapy.



 Manage patients according to clinical guidelines [e.g., National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP)] for the management of hyperlipidemia.



    5.5 Vaccinations



  No data are available on the response to vaccination or on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines to patients receiving XELJANZ. Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with XELJANZ.



 Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.

GATTEX,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (>= 10%) across all studies with GATTEX are abdominal pain, injection site reactions, nausea, headaches, abdominal distension, upper respiratory tract infection. In addition, vomiting and fluid overload were reported in the SBS studies (1 and 3) at rates >= 10%. (  6.1  )



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NPS Pharmaceuticals at 1-855-5GATTEX (1-855-542-8839) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch.    



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Across all clinical studies, 566 subjects were exposed to at least one dose of GATTEX (190 patient-years of exposure; mean duration of exposure was 17 weeks). Of the 566 subjects, 173 subjects were treated in Phase 3 SBS studies (134/173 [77%] at the dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day and 39/173 [23%] at the dose of 0.10 mg/kg/day).



 The most commonly reported (>= 10%) adverse reactions in patients treated with GATTEX across all clinical studies (n = 566) were: abdominal pain (30.0%); injection site reactions (22.4%); nausea (18.2%); headaches (15.9%); abdominal distension (13.8%); upper respiratory tract infection (11.8%).



 The rates of adverse reactions in subjects with SBS participating in two randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week, double-blind clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 3) are summarized in Table 1. Only those reactions with a rate of at least 5% in the GATTEX group, and greater than placebo group, are summarized in Table 1. The majority of these reactions were mild or moderate. Of subjects receiving GATTEX at the recommended dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day, 88.3% (N=68/77) experienced an adverse reaction, as compared to 83.1% (49/59) for placebo. Many of these adverse reactions have been reported in association with the underlying disease and/or parenteral nutrition.

     Adverse Reactions of Special Interest  



     Malignancy  . Three subjects were diagnosed with malignancy in the clinical studies, all of whom were male and had received GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day in Study 2. One subject had a history of abdominal radiation for Hodgkin's disease two decades prior to receiving GATTEX and prior liver lesion on CT scan, and was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unconfirmed origin after 11 months of exposure to GATTEX. Two subjects had extensive smoking histories, and were diagnosed with lung cancers (squamous and non-small cell) after 12 months and 3 months of GATTEX exposure, respectively.



     Colorectal Polyps  . In the clinical studies, 6 subjects were diagnosed with polyps of the G.I. tract after initiation of study treatment. In the SBS placebo-controlled studies, 1/59 (1.7%) of subjects on placebo and 1/109 (0.9%) of subjects on GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day were diagnosed with intestinal polyps (inflammatory stomal and hyperplastic sigmoidal after 3 and 5 months, respectively). The remaining 4 polyp cases occurred in the extension studies - two colorectal villous adenomas (onset at 6 and 7 months in GATTEX 0.10 and 0.05 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively), one hyperplastic polyp (onset 6 months in GATTEX 0.10 mg/kg/day dose group), and one small duodenal polyp (onset at 3 months in GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group).



     Gastrointestinal Obstruction  . Overall, 12 subjects experienced one or more episodes of intestinal obstruction/stenosis: 6 in SBS placebo-controlled studies and 6 in the extension studies. The 6 subjects in the placebo-controlled trials were all on GATTEX: 3/77 (3.9%) on GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day and 3/32 (9.4%) on GATTEX 0.10 mg/kg/day. No cases of intestinal obstruction occurred in the placebo group. Onsets ranged from 1 day to 6 months. In the extension studies, 6 additional subjects (all on GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day) were diagnosed with intestinal obstruction/stenosis with onsets ranging from 6 days to 7 months. Two of the 6 subjects from the placebo-controlled trials experienced recurrence of obstruction in the extension studies. Of all 8 subjects with an episode of intestinal obstruction/stenosis in these extension studies, 1 subject required endoscopic dilation and none required surgical intervention.



     Gallbladder, Biliary and Pancreatic Disease  . For gallbladder and biliary disease in the placebo-controlled studies, 3 subjects were diagnosed with cholecystitis, all of whom had a prior history of gallbladder disease and were in the GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group. No cases were reported in the placebo group. One of these 3 cases had gallbladder perforation and underwent cholecystectomy the next day. The remaining 2 cases underwent elective cholecystectomy at a later date. In the extension studies, 3 subjects had an episode of acute cholecystitis; 2 subjects had new-onset cholelithiasis; and 1 subject experienced cholestasis secondary to an obstructed biliary stent. For pancreatic disease in the placebo-controlled studies, 1 subject (GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group) had a pancreatic pseudocyst diagnosed after 4 months of GATTEX. In the extension studies, 1 subject was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis; and 1 subject was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis.



     Fluid Overload  . In the placebo-controlled trials, fluid overload was reported in 4/59 (6.8%) of subjects on placebo and 9/77 (11.7%) subjects on GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day. Of the 9 cases in the GATTEX group, there were 2 cases of congestive heart failure (CHF), 1 of whom was reported as a serious adverse event and the other as non-serious. The serious case had onset at 6 months, and was possibly associated with previously undiagnosed hypothyroidism and/or cardiac dysfunction.



     Concomitant Oral Medication  . GATTEX can increase the absorption of concomitant oral medications such as benzodiazepines and psychotropic agents. In the placebo-controlled trials, an analysis of episodes of cognition and attention disturbances was performed for subjects on benzodiazepines. One of the subjects in the GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day group (on prazepam) experienced dramatic deterioration in mental status progressing to coma during her first week of GATTEX therapy. She was admitted to the ICU where her benzodiazepine level was >300 mcg/L. GATTEX and prazepam were discontinued, and coma resolved 5 days later.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing peptides, administration of GATTEX may trigger the development of antibodies. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-national, multi-center, clinical trial (Study 1) in adults with SBS, the incidence of anti-GATTEX antibody was 0% (0/16) at Week 12 and 18% (6/34) at Week 24 in subjects who received subcutaneous administration of 0.05 mg/kg GATTEX once daily. The anti-GATTEX antibodies were cross-reactive to native glucagon-like peptide (GLP-2) in five of the six subjects (83%) who had anti-GATTEX antibodies. In the extension study (Study 2), the immunogenicity incidence rate increased over time to 27% (14/51) at 12 months and 38% (13/34) at 18 months. Anti-GATTEX antibodies appear to have no impact on short term (up to 1.5 years) efficacy and safety although the long-term impact is unknown.



 A total of 40 subjects were tested for neutralizing antibodies - 20 of these subjects had no neutralizing antibodies, and the remaining 20 subjects had no detectable neutralizing antibodies although, the presence of teduglutide at low levels in these study samples could have resulted in false negatives (no neutralizing antibody detected although present).



 Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying diseases. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to GATTEX with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

GATTEX,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Neoplastic growth. There is a risk for acceleration of neoplastic growth. Colonoscopy of the entire colon with removal of polyps should be done before initiating treatment with GATTEX and is recommended after 1 year. Subsequent colonoscopies should be done as needed, but no less frequently than every 5 years. In case of intestinal malignancy discontinue GATTEX. The clinical decision to continue GATTEX in patients with non-gastrointestinal malignancy should be made based on risk and benefit considerations. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Intestinal obstruction. In patients who develop obstruction, GATTEX should be temporarily discontinued pending further clinical evaluation and management. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Biliary and pancreatic disease. Patients should undergo laboratory assessment (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase) before starting GATTEX. Subsequent laboratory tests should be done every 6 months. If clinically meaningful changes are seen, further evaluation is recommended including imaging, and continued treatment with GATTEX should be reassessed. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Fluid overload. There is a potential for fluid overload while on GATTEX. If fluid overload occurs, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease, parenteral support should be appropriately adjusted, and GATTEX treatment reassessed. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Acceleration of Neoplastic Growth



  Based on the pharmacologic activity and findings in animals, GATTEX has the potential to cause hyperplastic changes including neoplasia. In patients at increased risk for malignancy, the clinical decision to use GATTEX should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks. In patients with active gastrointestinal malignancy (GI tract, hepatobiliary, pancreatic), GATTEX therapy should be discontinued. In patients with active non-gastrointestinal malignancy, the clinical decision to continue GATTEX should be made based on risk-benefit considerations. [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  and  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  



    Colorectal Polyps  



 Colorectal polyps were identified during the clinical trials. Colonoscopy of the entire colon with removal of polyps should be done within 6 months prior to starting treatment with GATTEX. A follow-up colonoscopy (or alternate imaging) is recommended at the end of 1 year of GATTEX. Subsequent colonoscopies should be done every 5 years or more often as needed. If a polyp is found, adherence to current polyp follow-up guidelines is recommended. In case of diagnosis of colorectal cancer, GATTEX therapy should be discontinued . [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  



    Small Bowel Neoplasia  



 Based on benign tumor findings in the rat carcinogenicity study, patients should be monitored clinically for small bowel neoplasia. If a benign neoplasm is found, it should be removed. In case of small bowel cancer, GATTEX therapy should be discontinued. [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  



    5.2 Intestinal Obstruction



  Intestinal obstruction has been reported in clinical trials. In patients who develop intestinal or stomal obstruction, GATTEX should be temporarily discontinued while the patient is clinically managed. GATTEX may be restarted when the obstructive presentation resolves, if clinically indicated. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  



    5.3 Biliary and Pancreatic Disease



   Gallbladder and Biliary Tract Disease  



 Cholecystitis, cholangitis, and cholelithiasis, have been reported in clinical studies. For identification of the onset or worsening of gallbladder/biliary disease, patients should undergo laboratory assessment of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase within 6 months prior to starting GATTEX, and at least every 6 months while on GATTEX; or more frequently if needed. If clinically meaningful changes are seen, further evaluation including imaging of the gallbladder and/or biliary tract is recommended; and the need for continued GATTEX treatment should be reassessed. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  



    Pancreatic Disease  



 Pancreatitis has been reported in clinical studies. For identification of onset or worsening of pancreatic disease, patients should undergo laboratory assessment of lipase and amylase within 6 months prior to starting GATTEX, and at least every 6 months while on GATTEX; or more frequently if needed. If clinically meaningful changes are seen, further evaluation such as imaging of the pancreas is recommended; and the need for continued GATTEX treatment should be reassessed. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  and  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  



    5.4 Fluid Overload



  Fluid overload and congestive heart failure have been observed in clinical trials, which were felt to be related to enhanced fluid absorption associated with GATTEX. If fluid overload occurs, parenteral support should be adjusted and GATTEX treatment should be reassessed, especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. If significant cardiac deterioration develops while on GATTEX, the need for continued GATTEX treatment should be reassessed. [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  



    5.5 Increased Absorption of Concomitant Oral Medication



  Altered mental status in association with GATTEX has been observed in patients on benzodiazepines in clinical trials.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In the randomized clinical trial in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases, 600 patients received intravenous injections of 50 kBq/kg (1.35 microcurie/kg) of Xofigo and best standard of care and 301 patients received placebo and best standard of care once every 4 weeks for up to 6 injections. Prior to randomization, 58% and 57% of patients had received docetaxel in the Xofigo and placebo arms, respectively. The median duration of treatment was 20 weeks (6 cycles) for Xofigo and 18 weeks (5 cycles) for placebo.



 The most common adverse reactions (>= 10%) in patients receiving Xofigo were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and peripheral edema (Table 3). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were reported among 57% of Xofigo-treated patients and 63% of placebo-treated patients. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities in Xofigo-treated patients (>= 10%) were anemia, lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia (Table 4).



 Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 17% of patients who received Xofigo and 21% of patients who received placebo. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities leading to discontinuation for Xofigo were anemia (2%) and thrombocytopenia (2%).



 Table 3 shows adverse reactions occurring in >= 2% of patients and for which the incidence for Xofigo exceeds the incidence for placebo.

  Laboratory values were obtained at baseline and prior to each 4-week cycle.    
           As an adverse reaction, grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 6% of patients on Xofigo and in 2% of patients on placebo. Among patients who received Xofigo, the laboratory abnormality grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 1% of docetaxel naive patients and in 4% of patients who had received prior docetaxel. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 1% of docetaxel naive patients and in 3% of patients who have received prior docetaxel.
 

   Fluid Status

  Dehydration occurred in 3% of patients on Xofigo and 1% of patients on placebo. Xofigo increases adverse reactions such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting which may result in dehydration. Monitor patients' oral intake and fluid status carefully and promptly treat patients who display signs or symptoms of dehydration or hypovolemia.



   Injection Site Reactions

  Erythema, pain, and edema at the injection site were reported in 1% of patients on Xofigo.



   Secondary Malignant Neoplasms

  Xofigo contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure may be associated with an increased risk of cancer and hereditary defects. Due to its mechanism of action and neoplastic changes, including osteosarcomas, in rats following administration of radium-223 dichloride, Xofigo may increase the risk of osteosarcoma or other secondary malignant neoplasms  [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1  )]  . However, the overall incidence of new malignancies in the randomized trial was lower on the Xofigo arm compared to placebo (<1% vs. 2%; respectively), but the expected latency period for the development of secondary malignancies exceeds the duration of follow up for patients on the trial.



   Subsequent Treatment with Cytotoxic Chemotherapy

  In the randomized clinical trial, 16% patients in the Xofigo group and 18% patients in the placebo group received cytotoxic chemotherapy after completion of study treatments. Adequate safety monitoring and laboratory testing was not performed to assess how patients treated with Xofigo will tolerate subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy.

XOFIGO,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  EXCERPT:   Bone Marrow Suppression: Measure blood counts prior to treatment initiation and before every dose of Xofigo. Discontinue Xofigo if hematologic values do not recover within 6 to 8 weeks after treatment. Monitor patients with compromised bone marrow reserve closely. Discontinue Xofigo in patients who experience life-threatening complications despite supportive care measures. (  5.1  )



 



   5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression



  In the randomized trial, 2% of patients on the Xofigo arm experienced bone marrow failure or ongoing pancytopenia compared to no patients treated with placebo. There were two deaths due to bone marrow failure and for 7 of 13 patients treated with Xofigo, bone marrow failure was ongoing at the time of death. Among the 13 patients who experienced bone marrow failure, 54% required blood transfusions. Four percent (4%) of patients on the Xofigo arm and 2% on the placebo arm permanently discontinued therapy due to bone marrow suppression.



 In the randomized trial, deaths related to vascular hemorrhage in association with myelosuppression were observed in 1% of Xofigo-treated patients compared to 0.3% of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of infection-related deaths (2%), serious infections (10%), and febrile neutropenia (<1%) were similar for patients treated with Xofigo and placebo. Myelosuppression; notably thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and leukopenia; has been reported in patients treated with Xofigo. In the randomized trial, complete blood counts (CBCs) were obtained every 4 weeks prior to each dose and the nadir CBCs and times of recovery were not well characterized. In a separate single-dose phase 1 study of Xofigo, neutrophil and platelet count nadirs occurred 2 to 3 weeks after Xofigo administration at doses that were up to 1 to 5 times the recommended dose, and most patients recovered approximately 6 to 8 weeks after administration [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .



 Hematologic evaluation of patients must be performed at baseline and prior to every dose of Xofigo. Before the first administration of Xofigo, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be >= 1.5 x 10  9  /L, the platelet count >= 100 x 10  9  /L and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL. Before subsequent administrations of Xofigo, the ANC should be >= 1 x 10  9  /L and the platelet count >= 50 x 10  9  /L. If there is no recovery to these values within 6 to 8 weeks after the last administration of Xofigo, despite receiving supportive care, further treatment with Xofigo should be discontinued. Patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve should be monitored closely and provided with supportive care measures when clinically indicated. Discontinue Xofigo in patients who experience life-threatening complications despite supportive care for bone marrow failure.



 The safety and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy with Xofigo have not been established. Outside of a clinical trial, concomitant use with chemotherapy is not recommended due to the potential for additive myelosuppression. If chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes or hemibody external radiotherapy are administered during the treatment period, Xofigo should be discontinued.

SYNRIBO,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The following serious adverse reactions have been associated with SYNRIBO in clinical trials and are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label.



 *    Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  
 *    Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  
 *    Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  
    Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 

 The safety data for SYNRIBO are from 3 clinical trials which enrolled a total of 163 adult patients with TKI resistant and/or intolerant chronic phase (N=108) and accelerated phase (N=55) CML. All patients were treated with initial induction therapy consisting of a dose of 1.25 mg/m  2  administered subcutaneously twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days (induction cycle). Responding patients were then treated with the same dose and a twice daily schedule for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (maintenance cycle).



   EXCERPT:   CML-Chronic Phase and Accelerated Phase: Most common adverse reactions (frequency >= 20%): thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, asthenia, injection site reaction, pyrexia, infection, and lymphopenia (  6.1  ).

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Chronic Phase CML  



 The median duration of exposure for the 108 patients with chronic phase CML was 7.4 months (range 0 to 43 months). The median total cycles of exposure was 6 (range 1 to 41), and the median total dose delivered during the trials was 131 mg/m  2  (range 1.2 to 678). Among the patients with chronic phase CML, 87% received 14 days of treatment during cycle 1. By cycles 2 and 3, the percentage of patients receiving 14 days of treatment decreased to 42% and 16% respectively. Of the 91 patients who received at least 2 cycles of treatment, 79 (87%) had at least 1 cycle delay during the trials. The median number of days of cycle delays was greatest for cycle 2 (17 days) and cycle 3 (25 days) when more patients were receiving induction cycles.



 Adverse reactions were reported for 99% of the patients with chronic phase CML. A total of 18% of patients had adverse reactions leading to withdrawal. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased alanine aminotransferase (each 2%). A total of 87% of patients reported at least 1 Grade 3 or Grade 4 treatment emergent adverse reaction (  Table 2  ).

         Serious adverse reactions were reported for 51% of patients. Serious adverse reactions reported for at least 5% of patients were bone marrow failure and thrombocytopenia (each 10%), and febrile neutropenia (6%). Serious adverse reactions of infections were reported for 8% of patients.
 

 Deaths occurred while on study in five (5%) patients with CP CML. Two patients died due to cerebral hemorrhage, one due to multi-organ failure, one due to progression of disease, and one from unknown causes.



   Accelerated Phase CML  



 Median total cycles of exposure was 2 (range 1 to 29), and the median total dose delivered during the trials was 70 mg/m  2  . The median duration of exposure for the 55 patients with accelerated phase CML was 1.9 months (range 0 to 30 months). Of the patients with accelerated phase CML, 86% received 14 days of treatment during cycle 1. By cycles 2 and 3, the percentage of patients receiving 14 days of treatment decreased to 55% and 44% respectively. Of the 40 patients who received at least 2 cycles of treatment, 27 (68%) had at least 1 cycle delay during the trials. The median number of days of cycle delays was greatest for cycle 3 (31 days) and cycle 8 (36 days).



 Adverse reactions regardless of investigator attribution were reported for 100% patients with accelerated phase CML. A total of 33% of patients had adverse reactions leading to withdrawal. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions leading to withdrawal were leukocytosis (6%), and thrombocytopenia (4%). A total of 84% of patients reported at least 1 Grade 3 or Grade 4 treatment emergent adverse reaction (  Table 3  ).

         Serious adverse reactions were reported for 60% of patients. Serious adverse reactions reported for at least 5% of patients were febrile neutropenia (18%), thrombocytopenia (9%), anemia (7%), and diarrhea (6%). Serious adverse reactions of infections were reported for 11% of patients.
 

 Death occurred while on study in 5 (9%) patients with AP CML. Two patients died due to cerebral hemorrhage and three due to progression of disease.



   Laboratory Abnormalities in Chronic and Accelerated Phase CML  



 Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities reported in patients with chronic and accelerated phase CML are described in  Table 4  . Myelosuppression occurred in all patients treated with SYNRIBO  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )].  Five patients with chronic phase CML and 4 patients with accelerated phase CML permanently discontinued SYNRIBO due to pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, or bone marrow necrosis. An event of hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia was reported in one patient in the safety population and a similar case has been reported in the literature. Two patients with chronic phase CML permanently discontinued SYNRIBO due to elevated transaminases.

SYNRIBO,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Myelosuppression: severe and fatal thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia. Monitor hematologic parameters frequently (  2.3  ,  5.1  ). 
 *    Bleeding: severe thrombocytopenia and increased risk of hemorrhage. Fatal cerebral hemorrhage and severe, non-fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage (  5.1  ,  5.2  ). 
 *    Hyperglycemia: glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia including hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia (  5.3  ). 
 *    Embryo-fetal toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy (  5.4  ,  8.1  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Myelosuppression



  In uncontrolled trials with SYNRIBO, patients with chronic phase and accelerated phase CML experienced NCI CTC (version 3.0) Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (85%, 88%), neutropenia (81%, 71%), and anemia (62%, 80%), respectively. Fatalities related to myelosuppression occurred in 3% of patients in the safety population (N=163). Patients with neutropenia are at increased risk for infections, and should be monitored frequently and advised to contact a physician if they have symptoms of infection or fever.



 Monitor complete blood counts weekly during induction and initial maintenance cycles and every two weeks during later maintenance cycles, as clinically indicated. In clinical trials myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by delaying next cycle and/or reducing days of treatment with SYNRIBO [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  



    5.2 Bleeding



  SYNRIBO causes severe thrombocytopenia which increases the risk of hemorrhage. In clinical trials with CP and AP CML patients, a high incidence of Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (85% and 88%, respectively) was observed. Fatalities from cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients treated with SYNRIBO in the safety population. Severe, non-fatal, gastrointestinal hemorrhages occurred in 2% of patients in the same population. Most bleeding events were associated with severe thrombocytopenia.



 Monitor platelet counts as part of the CBC monitoring as recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )].  Avoid anticoagulants, aspirin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when the platelet count is less than 50,000/uL as they may increase the risk of bleeding.



    5.3 Hyperglycemia



  SYNRIBO can induce glucose intolerance. Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia was reported in 11% of patients in the safety population. Hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia occurred in 1 patient treated with SYNRIBO in the safety population. Monitor blood glucose levels frequently, especially in patients with diabetes or risk factors for diabetes. Avoid SYNRIBO in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus until good glycemic control has been established.



    5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  SYNRIBO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate caused embryo-fetal death in animals. Females of reproductive potential should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with SYNRIBO. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of SYNRIBO in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )].

ICLUSIG,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information:



 *  Vascular Occlusion [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Heart Failure [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  
 *  Hepatotoxicity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  
 *  Hypertension [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
 *  Pancreatitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  
 *  Neuropathy [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  
 *  Ocular Toxicity [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  ]  
 *  Hemorrhage [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.8)  ]  
 *  Fluid Retention [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ]  
 *  Cardiac Arrhythmias [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.10)  ]  
 *  Myelosuppression [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.11)  ]  
    The adverse reactions described in this section were identified in a single-arm, open-label, international, multicenter trial in 449 patients with CML or Ph+ ALL whose disease was considered to be resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy including those with the BCR-ABL T315I mutation. All patients received a starting dose of 45 mg Iclusig once daily. At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment with Iclusig was 337 days in patients with CP-CML, 362 days in patients with AP-CML, 89 days in patients with BP-CML, and 81 days in patients with Ph+ ALL. The median dose intensity was 37 mg or 83% of the expected 45 mg dose. The events of arterial ischemia, cardiac failure, and peripheral neuropathy reported in Tables 5 and 6 below include data from an additional 13 months of follow-up (median duration of treatment CP-CML: 672 days, AP-CML: 590 days, BP-CML: 89 days, Ph+ ALL: 81 days).
 

 Adverse reactions reported in more than 10% of all patients treated with Iclusig in this trial are presented in Table 5. Overall, the most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (>= 20%) were hypertension, rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, dry skin, constipation, arthralgia, nausea, and pyrexia.



 The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in discontinuation were 13% in CP-CML, 11% in AP-CML, 15% in BP-CML, and 9% in Ph+ ALL. The most common adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation were thrombocytopenia (4%) and infections (1%).



 Dose modifications (dose delays or dose reductions) due to adverse reactions occurred in 74% of the patients. The most common adverse reactions (>=5%) that led to dose modifications include thrombocytopenia (30%), neutropenia (13%), lipase increased (12%), rash (11%), abdominal pain (11%), pancreatitis (6%), and ALT, AST, or GGT increased (6%).

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: VASCULAR OCCLUSION, HEART FAILURE, and HEPATOTOXICITY

    WARNING: VASCULAR OCCLUSION, HEART FAILURE, and HEPATOTOXICITY  

      Vascular Occlusion:    



 *  Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions have occurred in at least 27% of Iclusig treated patients, including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the need for urgent revascularization procedures. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these events (5.1). 
 *  Monitor for evidence of thromboembolism and vascular occlusion. Interrupt or stop Iclusig immediately for vascular occlusion. A benefit-risk consideration should guide a decision to restart Iclusig therapy (5.1). 
      Heart Failure:  
 

 *  Heart failure, including fatalities, occurred in 8% of Iclusig-treated patients. Monitor cardiac function. Interrupt or stop Iclusig for new or worsening heart failure (5.2). 
      Hepatotoxicity:   
 

 *  Hepatotoxicity, liver failure and death have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Monitor hepatic function. Interrupt Iclusig if hepatotoxicity is suspected (2.3, 5.3).

   5.1 Vascular Occlusion



   Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions, including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the need for urgent revascularization procedures have occurred in at least 27% of Iclusig-treated patients from the phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Iclusig can cause fatal and life-threatening vascular occlusion within 2 weeks of starting treatment. Iclusig can also cause recurrent or multi-site vascular occlusion.  



  In the dose-escalation (phase 1) clinical trial, 48% (31/65) of patients with CML or Ph+ ALL developed vascular occlusive events. The median time to onset of the first vascular occlusion event was 5 months. Iclusig can cause fatal and life-threatening vascular occlusion in patients treated at dose levels as low as 15 mg per day.  



  Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these events. Vascular occlusion adverse events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with prior history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia (see  Table 4  ).

  Total                              24%(109/449)                 
             Arterial Occlusion and Thrombosis    
 

  Arterial occlusion and thrombosis occurred in at least 20% (91/449) of Iclusig-treated patients with some patients experiencing events of more than one type. Patients have required revascularization procedures (cerebrovascular, coronary, and peripheral arterial) due to vascular occlusion from Iclusig.  



  Cardiac vascular occlusion, including fatal and life-threatening myocardial infarction and coronary artery occlusion has occurred in 12% (55/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Patients have developed heart failure concurrent or subsequent to the myocardial ischemic event.  



  Cerebrovascular occlusion, including fatal stroke, has occurred in 6% (27/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Iclusig can cause stenosis over multiple segments in major arterial vessels that supply the brain (e.g., carotid, vertebral, middle cerebral artery).  



  Peripheral arterial occlusive events, including fatal mesenteric artery occlusion and life-threatening peripheral arterial disease, have occurred in 8% (36/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Patients have developed digital or distal extremity necrosis and have required amputations.  



  Clinicians should consider whether the benefits of Iclusig treatment are expected to exceed the risks of therapy. In patients suspected of developing arterial thrombotic events, interrupt or stop Iclusig. A benefit-risk consideration should guide a decision to restart Iclusig therapy. [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  



     Venous Thromboembolism    



  Venous thromboembolic events occurred in 5% (23/449) of Iclusig-treated patients, including deep venous thrombosis (8 patients), pulmonary embolism (6 patients), superficial thrombophlebitis (3 patients), and retinal vein thrombosis (2 patients). Consider dose modification or discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolism [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  



    5.2 Heart Failure



   Fatal and serious heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 5% of Iclusig-treated patients (N =22). Eight percent of patients (N= 35) experienced any grade of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and treat as clinically indicated, including interruption of Iclusig. Consider discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious heart failure [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  



    5.3 Hepatotoxicity



  Iclusig can cause hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in an Iclusig-treated patient within one week of starting Iclusig. Two additional fatal cases of acute liver failure also occurred. The fatal cases occurred in patients with blast phase (BP) CML or Ph+ ALL. Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in all disease cohorts.



 The incidence of aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) or alanine aminotransferase (AST) elevation was 56% (all grades) and 8% (grade 3 or 4). Iclusig treatment may result in elevation in ALT, AST, or both. ALT or AST elevation was not reversed by the date of last follow-up in 5% of patients.



 Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.4 Hypertension



   Treatment-emergent hypertension occurred in 67% of patients (300/449). Eight patients (2%) treated with Iclusig in clinical trials experienced treatment-emergent symptomatic hypertension as a serious adverse reaction, including hypertensive crisis. Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  . In patients with baseline systolic BP<140 mm Hg and baseline diastolic BP<90mm Hg, 78% (220/282) experienced treatment-emergent hypertension; 49% (139/282) developed Stage 1 hypertension (defined as systolic BP>=140 mm Hg or diastolic BP>=90 mm Hg) while 29% developed Stage 2 hypertension (defined as systolic BP>=160 mm Hg or diastolic BP>=100 mm Hg). In 131 patients with Stage 1 hypertension at baseline, 61% (80/131) developed Stage 2 hypertension. Monitor and manage blood pressure elevations during Iclusig use and treat hypertension to normalize blood pressure. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop Iclusig if hypertension is not medically controlled.  



    5.5 Pancreatitis



  Clinical pancreatitis occurred in 6% (28/449) of patients (5% grade 3) treated with Iclusig. Pancreatitis resulted in discontinuation or treatment interruption in 6% of patients (25/449). Twenty-two of the 28 cases of pancreatitis resolved within 2 weeks with dose interruption or reduction. The incidence of treatment-emergent lipase elevation was 41%.



 Check serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Dose interruption or reduction may be required. In cases where lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt treatment with Iclusig and evaluate patients for pancreatitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  Do not consider restarting Iclusig until patients have complete resolution of symptoms and lipase levels are less than 1.5 * ULN.



    5.6 Neuropathy



   Peripheral and cranial neuropathy have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Overall, 13% (59/449) of Iclusig-treated patients experienced a peripheral neuropathy event of any grade (2%, grade 3/4). In clinical trials, the most common peripheral neuropathies reported were peripheral neuropathy (4%, 18/449), paresthesia (4%, 17/449), hypoesthesia (2%, 11/449), and hyperesthesia (1%, 5/449). Cranial neuropathy developed in 1% (6/449) of Iclusig-treated patients (<1% grade 3/4).  



  Of the patients who developed neuropathy, 31% (20/65) developed neuropathy during the first month of treatment. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Consider interrupting Iclusig and evaluate if neuropathy is suspected.  



    5.7 Ocular Toxicity



   Serious ocular toxicities leading to blindness or blurred vision have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Retinal toxicities including macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal hemorrhage occurred in 3% of Iclusig-treated patients. Conjunctival or corneal irritation, dry eye, or eye pain occurred in 13% of patients. Visual blurring occurred in 6% of patients. Other ocular toxicities include cataracts, glaucoma, iritis, iridocyclitis, and ulcerative keratitis. Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .  



    5.8 Hemorrhage



  Serious bleeding events, including fatalities, occurred in 5% (22/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. Hemorrhage occurred in 24% of patients. The incidence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL. Cerebral hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were the most commonly reported serious bleeding events. Most hemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia [   see  Warnings and Precautions (5.11)  ]  . Interrupt Iclusig for serious or severe hemorrhage and evaluate [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.9 Fluid Retention



  Fluid retention events judged as serious occurred in 3% (13/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. One instance of brain edema was fatal. Serious fluid retention events in more than 1 patient included: pericardial effusion (6/449, 1%), pleural effusion (5/449, 1%), and ascites (2/449, <1%).



 In total, fluid retention occurred in 23% of the patients. The most common fluid retention events were peripheral edema (16%), pleural effusion (7%), and pericardial effusion (3%).



 Monitor patients for fluid retention and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce, or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



    5.10 Cardiac Arrhythmias



  Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias that led to a requirement for pacemaker implantation occurred in 1% (3/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. The cardiac rhythms (1 case each) identified were complete heart block, sick sinus syndrome, and atrial fibrillation with bradycardia and pauses. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness, or chest pain). Interrupt Iclusig and evaluate.



 Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 5% (25/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Atrial fibrillation was the most common supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and occurred in 20 patients. The other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were atrial flutter (4 patients), supraventricular tachycardia (4 patients), and atrial tachycardia (1 patient). For 13 patients, the event led to hospitalization. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of rapid heart rate (palpitations, dizziness). Interrupt Iclusig and evaluate.



    5.11 Myelosuppression



  Severe (grade 3 or 4) myelosuppression occurred in 48% (215/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. The incidence of these events was greater in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ALL than in patients with CP-CML. Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated, and adjust the dose as recommended [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.12 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Two patients (<1%) treated with Iclusig developed serious tumor lysis syndrome. Both cases occurred in patients with advanced CML. Hyperuricemia occurred in 7% (30/449) of patients; the majority had CP-CML (19 patients). Due to the potential for tumor lysis syndrome in patients with advanced disease (AP-CML, BP-CML, or Ph+ ALL), ensure adequate hydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with Iclusig.



    5.13 Compromised Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation



  No formal studies of the effect of Iclusig on wound healing have been conducted. Based on the mechanism of action [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ]  , Iclusig could compromise wound healing. Serious gastrointestinal perforation (fistula) occurred in one patient 38 days post-cholecystectomy.



 Interrupt Iclusig for at least 1 week prior to major surgery. The decision when to resume Iclusig after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing.



    5.14 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Iclusig can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. Ponatinib caused embryo-fetal toxicity in rats at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended human dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Advise women to avoid pregnancy while taking Iclusig [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .

             Infantile Spasms    In a randomized, placebo-controlled IS study with a 5 day double-blind treatment phase (n=40), the adverse events reported by >5% of patients receiving SABRIL and that occurred more frequently than in placebo patients, were somnolence (SABRIL 45%,   placebo  30%), bronchitis (SABRIL 30%,  placebo  15%), ear infection (SABRIL 10%,   placebo  5%), and otitis media acute SABRIL 10%,   placebo  0%).
 

 In a dose response study of low-dose (18-36 mg/kg/day) versus high-dose (100-148 mg/kg/day) vigabatrin, no clear correlation between dose and incidence of adverse events was observed. The treatment emergent adverse reactions (>=5% in either dose group) are summarized in Table 7.

   The following adverse reactions have been reported during post approval use of SABRIL worldwide. All adverse reactions that are not listed above as adverse reactions reported in clinical trials, that are not relatively common in the population and are not too vague to be useful are listed in this section. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size; therefore, it is not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    BOXED WARNING:  WARNING:  VISION LOSS

     WARNING:  VISION LOSS  

    *  SABRIL causes permanent bilateral concentric visual field constriction. Because assessing vision may be difficult in infants and children, the frequency and extent of vision loss is poorly characterized in these patients. For this reason, the risk described below is primarily based on the adult experience. 
 *  Based upon adult studies, 30 percent or more of patients can be affected, ranging in severity from mild to severe, including tunnel vision to within 10 degrees of visual fixation, and can result in disability. In some cases, SABRIL also can damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. 
 *  The onset of vision loss from SABRIL is unpredictable, and can occur within weeks of starting treatment or sooner, or at any time after starting treatment, even after months or years. 
 *  Symptoms of vision loss from SABRIL are unlikely to be recognized by patients or caregivers before vision loss is severe. Vision loss of milder severity, while often unrecognized by the patient or caregiver, can still adversely affect function. 
 *  The risk of vision loss increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure, but there is no dose or exposure known to be free of risk of vision loss. 
 *  Unless a patient is formally exempted from periodic ophthalmologic assessment as documented in the SHARE program, vision should be assessed to the extent possible at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting SABRIL) and at least every 3 months during therapy. Vision assessment is also required about 3 to 6 months after the discontinuation of SABRIL therapy. 
 *  Once detected, vision loss due to SABRIL is not reversible. It is expected that, even with frequent monitoring, some patients will develop severe vision loss. 
 *  Drug discontinuation should be considered, balancing benefit and risk, if visual loss is documented. 
 *  It is possible that vision loss can worsen despite discontinuation of SABRIL. 
 *  Because of the risk of visual loss, SABRIL should be withdrawn from patients with refractory complex partial seizures who fail to show substantial clinical benefit within 3 months of initiation and within 2-4 weeks of initiation for patients with infantile spasms, or sooner if treatment failure becomes obvious. Patient response to and continued need for SABRIL should be periodically reassessed. 
 *  SABRIL should not be used in patients with, or at high risk of, other types of irreversible vision loss unless the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks. The interaction of other types of irreversible vision damage with vision damage from SABRIL has not been well-characterized, but is likely adverse. 
 *  SABRIL should not be used with other drugs associated with serious adverse ophthalmic effects such as retinopathy or glaucoma unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. 
 *  The possibility that vision loss from SABRIL may be more common, more severe or have more severe functional consequences in infants and children than in adults cannot be excluded. 
 *  The lowest dose and shortest exposure to SABRIL consistent with clinical objectives should be used. 
      Because of the risk of permanent vision loss, SABRIL is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the SHARE Program   [see           Warnings and Precautions (5.2)          ]  . Further information is available at [www.sabril.net or 1-888-45-SHARE].  
 

   EXCERPT:     WARNING: VISION LOSS  



     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.    



 *  SABRIL causes progressive and permanent bilateral concentric visual field constriction in a high percentage of patients. In some cases, SABRIL may also reduce visual acuity (5.1). 
 *  Risk increases with total dose and duration of use, but no exposure to SABRIL is known that is free of risk of vision loss (5.1). 
 *  Risk of new and worsening vision loss continues as long as SABRIL is used, and possibly after discontinuing SABRIL (5.1). 
 *  Unless a patient is formally exempted, periodic vision assessment is required for patients on SABRIL. However, this assessment cannot always prevent vision damage (5.1). 
 *  SABRIL can cause permanent vision loss. SABRIL is available only through a restricted program called the SHARE Program (5.2).

    5.1        Vision Loss  



   Because of the risk of vision loss, and because, when it is effective, SABRIL provides an observable symptomatic benefit, patient response and continued need for treatment should be periodically assessed.  



  In patients with refractory complex partial seizures, SABRIL should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 3 months of initiating treatment. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 3 months, treatment should be discontinued at that time.  



  In patients with infantile spasms, SABRIL should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 2 to 4 weeks. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 2 to 4 weeks, treatment should be discontinued at that time [see  BOXED WARNING  ].    



   Monitoring of Vision    



 Monitoring of vision by an ophthalmic professional with expertise in visual field interpretation and the ability to perform dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy of the retina is required, unless a patient is formally exempted from periodic ophthalmologic assessment as documented in the Support, Help And Resources for Epilepsy (SHARE) program [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  Because vision testing in infants is difficult, vision loss may not be detected until it is severe. For patients receiving SABRIL who are not exempted, vision assessment is required at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting SABRIL) and at least every 3 months while on therapy and about 3-6 months after the discontinuation of therapy.



  The diagnostic approach should be individualized for the patient and clinical situation.  For all patients, attempts to monitor vision periodically and/or formal exemptions must be documented under the SHARE program.  In adults and cooperative pediatric patients, perimetry is recommended, preferably by automated threshold visual field testing.  Additional testing may also include electrophysiology (e.g., electroretinography [ERG]), retinal imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography [OCT]), and/or other methods appropriate for the patient, but this additional testing is not required. In patients exempted from vision testing, treatment may continue according to clinical judgment, with appropriate patient counseling and with documentation in the SHARE program of the exemption.  Because of variability, results from ophthalmic monitoring must be interpreted with caution, and repeat assessment is recommended if results are abnormal or uninterpretable.  Repeat assessment in the first few weeks of treatment is recommended to establish if, and to what degree, reproducible results can be obtained, and to guide selection of appropriate ongoing monitoring for the patient.



 The onset and progression of vision loss from SABRIL is unpredictable, and it may occur or worsen precipitously between assessments.  Once detected, vision loss due to SABRIL is not reversible. It is expected that even with frequent monitoring, some SABRIL patients will develop severe vision loss. Drug discontinuation should be considered, balancing benefit and risk, if visual loss is documented.



     5.2        SABRIL SHARE Program  



  SABRIL is available only through a restricted distribution program called the SHARE program, because of the risk of vision loss.



 Notable requirements components of the SHARE Program include the following:



 *  *  Assess vision prior to initiating therapy and then every 3 months during therapy. 
 *  Remove patients from SABRIL therapy if the patients do not experience a meaningful reduction in seizures. 
 *  *  The patient is blind (subsequent Ophthalmologic Assessment Forms do not need to be submitted to the REMS coordinating center) 
 *  The patient's general neurological and/or mental condition permanently precludes the need for visual assessment (subsequent Ophthalmologic Assessment Forms do not need to be submitted to the REMS coordinating center) 
 *  The patient's general neurological condition temporarily precludes the ability to assess visual function.  The evaluation, however, may be performed at a later time as clinically appropriate. 
 *  The patient's medical condition prevents visual assessment being performed safely 
 *  For other reasons specified by the prescriber 
   The prescriber may, with appropriate documentation and caregiver counseling, exempt certain patients from vision assessment, using the Ophthalmologic Assessment Form, if: 
   Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and reviewing educational materials and comply with the following: 
 *  Patient/parent/legal guardian must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. 
 *  Pharmacies that dispense SABRIL must be certified and agree to comply with the REMS requirements.   Certified pharmacies must only dispense SABRIL to patients who are enrolled in the program. 
        5.3        Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Abnormalities in Infants  
 

  Abnormal MRI signal changes characterized by increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion in a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum have been observed in some infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms. In a retrospective epidemiologic study in infants with IS (N=205), the prevalence of these changes was 22% in vigabatrin treated patients versus 4% in patients treated with other therapies. 



 In the study above, in post marketing experience, and in published literature reports, these changes generally resolved with discontinuation of treatment. In a few patients, the lesion resolved despite continued use.  It has been reported that some infants exhibited coincident motor abnormalities, but no causal relationship has been established and the potential for long-term clinical sequelae has not been adequately studied.



 Neurotoxicity (brain histopathology and neurobehavioral abnormalities) was observed in rats exposed to vigabatrin during late gestation and the neonatal and juvenile periods of development.  The relationship between these findings and the abnormal MRI findings in infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms is unknown [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



 The specific pattern of signal changes observed in IS patients was not observed in older pediatric and adult patients treated with vigabatrin for refractory CPS. In a blinded review of MRI images obtained in prospective clinical trials in patients with refractory CPS 3 years and older (N=656), no difference was observed in anatomic distribution or prevalence of MRI signal changes between vigabatrin treated and placebo treated patients.



 For adults treated with SABRIL, routine MRI surveillance is unnecessary as there is no evidence that vigabatrin causes MRI changes in this population.



     5.4        Neurotoxicity  



  Vacuolation, characterized by fluid accumulation and separation of the outer layers of myelin, has been observed in brain white matter tracts in adult and juvenile rats and adult mice, dogs, and possibly monkeys following administration of vigabatrin. This lesion, referred to as intramyelinic edema (IME), was seen in animals at doses within the human therapeutic range. A no-effect dose was not established in rodents or dogs. In the rat and dog, vacuolation was reversible following discontinuation of vigabatrin treatment, but, in the rat, pathologic changes consisting of swollen or degenerating axons, mineralization, and gliosis were seen in brain areas in which vacuolation had been previously observed.  Vacuolation in adult animals was correlated with alterations in MRI and changes in visual and somatosensory evoked potentials (EP).



 Administration of vigabatrin to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development produced vacuolar changes in the brain gray matter (areas including the thalamus, midbrain, deep cerebellar nuclei, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and forebrain) which are considered distinct from the IME observed in vigabatrin treated adult animals. Decreased myelination and evidence of oligodendrocyte injury were additional findings in the brains of vigabatrin-treated rats.  An increase in apoptosis was seen in some brain regions following vigabatrin exposure during the early postnatal period.   Long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) were also observed following vigabatrin treatment of young rats. These effects in young animals occurred at doses lower than those producing neurotoxicity in adult animals and were associated with plasma vigabatrin levels substantially lower than those achieved clinically in infants and children [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



 In a published study, vigabatrin (200, 400 mg/kg/day) induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain of young rats when administered by intraperitoneal injection on postnatal days 5-7.



 Administration of vigabatrin to female rats during pregnancy and lactation at doses below those used clinically resulted in hippocampal vacuolation and convulsions in the mature offspring.



 Abnormal MRI signal changes characterized by increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion in a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum have been observed in some infants treated for IS with vigabatrin.  Studies of the effects of vigabatrin on MRI and EP in adult epilepsy patients have demonstrated no clear-cut abnormalities [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



     5.5        Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  



  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including SABRIL, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.



 Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug treated patients in the trials and none in placebo treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.



 The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.



 The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.



 Table 4. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis 
   Indication       Placebo Patients with Events per 1000 Patients    Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients     Relative Risk: Incidence of Drug Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients      Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients    
  Epilepsy         1.0              3.4              3.5              2.4              
  Psychiatric      5.7              8.5              1.5              2.9              
  Other            1.0              1.8              1.9              0.9              
  Total            2.4              4.3              1.8              1.9              
           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.
 

 Anyone considering prescribing SABRIL or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.



 Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.



     5.6        Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)  



  As with all AEDs, SABRIL should be withdrawn gradually. Patients and caregivers should be told not to suddenly discontinue SABRIL therapy.



 In controlled clinical studies in adults with complex partial seizures, SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose 1000 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued.



 In a controlled study in pediatric patients with complex partial seizures, SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose by one third every week for three weeks.



 In a controlled clinical study in patients with infantile spasms, SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose at a rate of 25-50 mg/kg every 3-4 days [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  



     5.7        Anemia  



  In North American controlled trials in adults, 6% of patients (16/280) receiving SABRIL and 2% of patients (3/188) receiving placebo had adverse events of anemia and/or met criteria for potentially clinically important hematology changes involving hemoglobin, hematocrit, and/or RBC indices.  Across U.S. controlled trials, there were mean decreases in hemoglobin of about 3% and 0% in SABRIL and placebo treated patients, respectively, and a mean decrease in hematocrit of about 1% in SABRIL treated patients compared to a mean gain of about 1% in patients treated with placebo.



 In controlled and open label epilepsy trials in adults and pediatric patients, 3 SABRIL patients (0.06%, 3/4855) discontinued for anemia and 2 SABRIL patients experienced unexplained declines in hemoglobin to below 8 g/dL and/or hematocrit below 24%.



     5.8        Somnolence and Fatigue  



  SABRIL causes somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or operate other complex machinery until they are familiar with the effects of SABRIL on their ability to perform such activities.



 Pooled data from two SABRIL controlled trials in adults demonstrated that 24% (54/222) of SABRIL patients experienced somnolence compared to 10% (14/135) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 28% of SABRIL patients experienced fatigue compared to 15% (20/135) of placebo patients. Almost 1% of SABRIL patients discontinued from clinical trials for somnolence and almost 1% discontinued for fatigue.



  Pooled data from three SABRIL controlled trials in pediatric patients demonstrated that 6% (10/165) of SABRIL patients experienced somnolence compared to 5% (5/104) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 10% (17/165) of SABRIL patients experienced fatigue compared to 7% (7/104) of placebo patients. No SABRIL patients discontinued from clinical trials due to somnolence or fatigue.  



     5.9        Peripheral Neuropathy  



  SABRIL causes symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, but observed incidence of symptoms based on pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo. In a pool of North American controlled and uncontrolled epilepsy studies, 4.2% (19/457) of SABRIL patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In the subset of North American placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, 1.4% (4/280) of SABRIL treated patients and no (0/188) placebo patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestations of peripheral neuropathy in these trials included, in some combination, symptoms of numbness or tingling in the toes or feet, signs of reduced distal lower limb vibration or position sensation, or progressive loss of reflexes, starting at the ankles. Clinical studies in the development program were not designed to investigate peripheral neuropathy systematically and did not include nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, or skin or nerve biopsy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if development of these signs and symptoms were related to duration of SABRIL treatment, cumulative dose, or if the findings of peripheral neuropathy were completely reversible upon discontinuation of SABRIL.



     5.10        Weight Gain  



  SABRIL causes weight gain in adult and pediatric patients.



 Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in adults found that 17% (77/443) of SABRIL patients versus 8% (22/275) of placebo patients gained >=7% of baseline body weight. In these same trials, the mean weight change among SABRIL patients was 3.5 kg compared to 1.6 kg for placebo patients.



  Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients with refractory complex partial seizures found that 47% (77/163) of SABRIL patients versus 19% (19/102) of placebo patients gained >=7% of baseline body weight.  



  In all epilepsy trials, 0.6% (31/4855) of SABRIL patients discontinued for weight gain. The long term effects of SABRIL related weight gain are not known. Weight gain was not related to the occurrence of edema.  



     5.11        Edema  



  SABRIL causes edema in adults.  Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess edema, but observed incidence of edema based pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo.



 Pooled data from controlled trials demonstrated increased risk among SABRIL patients compared to placebo patients for peripheral edema (SABRIL 2%, placebo 1%), and edema (SABRIL 1%, placebo 0%). In these studies, one SABRIL and no placebo patients discontinued for an edema related AE. In adults, there was no apparent association between edema and cardiovascular adverse events such as hypertension or congestive heart failure. Edema was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of deterioration in renal or hepatic function.

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure of 94 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who received VPRIV at doses ranging from 15 Units/kg to 60 Units/kg every other week in 5 clinical studies. Fifty-four (54) patients were naive to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and received VPRIV for 9 months and 40 patients switched from imiglucerase to VPRIV treatment and received VPRIV for 12 months [  see  Clinical Studies (14)    ]. Patients were between 4 and 71 years old at time of first treatment with VPRIV, and included 46 male and 48 female patients.



 The most serious adverse reactions in patients treated with VPRIV were hypersensitivity reactions [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ].



 The most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in >=10% of patients) that were considered related to VPRIV are shown in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions were hypersensitivity reactions.

         Less common adverse reactions affecting more than one patient (>2% in the treatment-naive group and > 3% in patients switched from imiglucerase to VPRIV treatment) were bone pain, tachycardia, rash, urticaria, flushing, hypertension, and hypotension.
 

     Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients  



 The safety profile of VPRIV was similar between pediatric patients (ages 4 to 17 years) and adult patients. Adverse reactions more commonly seen in pediatric patients compared to adult patients include (>10% difference): rash, aPTT prolonged, and pyrexia.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In clinical studies, 1 of 54 enzyme treatment-naive patients treated with VPRIV developed IgG class antibodies to VPRIV. In this patient, the antibodies were determined to be neutralizing in an  in vitro  assay. No hypersensitivity reactions were reported for this patient. It is unknown if the presence of IgG antibodies to VPRIV is associated with a higher risk of infusion reactions. Patients with an immune response to other enzyme replacement therapies who are switching to VPRIV should continue to be monitored for antibodies to VPRIV.



 Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to VPRIV with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

  EXCERPT:   Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis :  



 *  Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have occurred.(  5.1  ) 
 *  Ensure that personnel administering product are adequately trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures, and have ready access to emergency medical services (  5.1  ) 
 *  Consider slowing infusion rate, treatment with antihistamines, antipyretics and/or corticosteroids, and/or stopping treatment if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during an infusion. Consider pre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids in patients with prior reactions (  5.1  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis



   Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, occurred in clinical studies and postmarketing experience. [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Hypersensitivity reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with VPRIV in clinical studies. Patients were not routinely pre-medicated prior to infusion of VPRIV during clinical studies. The most commonly observed symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions were: headache, dizziness, hypotension, hypertension, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, and pyrexia/body temperature increased. Generally the reactions were mild and, in treatment-naive patients, onset occurred mostly during the first 6 months of treatment and tended to occur less frequently with time. Additional hypersensitivity reactions of chest discomfort, dyspnea, and pruritus have been reported in post-marketing experience.  



 As with any intravenous protein product, hypersensitivity reactions are possible, therefore appropriate medical support including personnel adequately trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures and access to emergency measures should be readily available when VPRIV is administered. If anaphylactic or other acute reactions occur, immediately discontinue the infusion of VPRIV and initiate appropriate medical treatment.



 The management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction, e.g., slowing the infusion rate, treatment with medications such as antihistamines, antipyretics and/or corticosteroids, and/or stopping and resuming treatment with increased infusion time. In cases where patients have exhibited symptoms of hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or excipients in the drug product or to other enzyme replacement therapy, pre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions.

  6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Studies

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety data described below reflect exposure of 4438 patients to DALIRESP 500 mcg once daily in four 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 6-month placebo-controlled trials, and two 6-month drug add-on trials  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )].  In these trials, 3136 and 1232 COPD patients were exposed to DALIRESP 500 mcg once daily for 6 months and 1-year, respectively.



 The population had a median age of 64 years (range 40-91), 73% were male, 92.9% were Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 8.9 to 89.1% predicted. In these trials, 68.5% of the patients treated with DALIRESP reported an adverse reaction compared with 65.3% treated with placebo.



 The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reaction was 14.8% for DALIRESP-treated patients and 9.9% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of DALIRESP were diarrhea (2.4%) and nausea (1.6%).



 Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, which occurred more frequently in DALIRESP-treated patients include diarrhea, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, prostate cancer, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure.



   Table 1  summarizes the adverse reactions reported by >= 2% of patients in the DALIRESP group in 8 controlled COPD clinical trials.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reports of DALIRESP received worldwide and have not been listed elsewhere. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting or potential causal connection to DALIRESP. Because these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to DALIRESP exposure:  hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, urticaria, and rash.

DALIRESP,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Acute bronchospasm: Do not use for the relief of acute bronchospasm. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Psychiatric Events including Suicidality: Advise patients, their caregivers, and families to be alert for the emergence or worsening of insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with DALIRESP in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Weight Decrease: Monitor weight regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, evaluate weight loss and consider discontinuation of DALIRESP. (  5.3  ) 
 *    Drug Interactions: Use with strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommended. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Treatment of Acute Bronchospasm



  DALIRESP is not a bronchodilator and should not be used for the relief of acute bronchospasm.



    5.2 Psychiatric Events including Suicidality



  Treatment with DALIRESP is associated with an increase in psychiatric adverse reactions. In 8 controlled clinical trials 5.9% (263) of patients treated with DALIRESP 500 mcg daily reported psychiatric adverse reactions compared to 3.3% (137) treated with placebo. The most commonly reported psychiatric adverse reactions were insomnia, anxiety, and depression which were reported at higher rates in those treated with DALIRESP 500 mcg daily (2.4%, 1.4%, and 1.2% for DALIRESP versus 1.0%, 0.9%, and 0.9% for placebo, respectively) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Instances of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in clinical trials. Three patients experienced suicide-related adverse reactions (one completed suicide and two suicide attempts) while receiving DALIRESP compared to one patient (suicidal ideation) who received placebo. Cases of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in the post-marketing setting in patients with or without a history of depression.



 Before using DALIRESP in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior, prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with DALIRESP in such patients. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with DALIRESP if such events occur.



    5.3 Weight Decrease



  Weight loss was a common adverse reaction in DALIRESP clinical trials and was reported in 7.5% (331) of patients treated with DALIRESP 500 mcg once daily compared to 2.1% (89) treated with placebo [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ]. In addition to being reported as adverse reactions, weight was prospectively assessed in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of one year duration. In these studies, 20% of patients receiving roflumilast experienced moderate weight loss (defined as between 5-10% of body weight) compared to 7% of patients who received placebo. In addition, 7% of patients who received roflumilast compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo experienced severe (>10% body weight) weight loss. During follow-up after treatment discontinuation, the majority of patients with weight loss regained some of the weight they had lost while receiving DALIRESP. Patients treated with DALIRESP should have their weight monitored regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, weight loss should be evaluated, and discontinuation of DALIRESP should be considered.



    5.4 Drug Interactions



  A major step in roflumilast metabolism is the N-oxidation of roflumilast to roflumilast N-oxide by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. The administration of the cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer rifampicin resulted in a reduction in exposure, which may result in a decrease in the therapeutic effectiveness of DALIRESP. Therefore, the use of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) with DALIRESP is not recommended [ see Drugs That Induce Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes (  7.1  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The most common adverse reactions (> 10% compared to placebo) during treatment with SYLVANT in the MCD clinical trial were pruritus, increased weight, rash, hyperuricemia, and upper respiratory tract infection.



 The data presented below in  Table 3  were collected from Study 1. Study 1, in MCD, was an international, multicenter, randomized Phase 2 study of every 3 week infusions comparing SYLVANT and best supportive care (BSC) to placebo and BSC. There were 53 patients randomized to the SYLVANT arm at a dose of 11 mg/kg and 26 patients randomized to the placebo arm. Of the 26 placebo-treated patients, 13 patients subsequently crossed-over to receive SYLVANT. The median age was 48 years (range 20 to 78), 66% male, 48% Asian, 39% White, 4% Black or African American, 7% other. The patients randomized to SYLVANT received a median of 19 infusions (range 1 to 50) compared to patients randomized to placebo who received a median of 8 infusions (range 2 to 32). To control for disparate exposure between arms,  Table 3  reports the per patient incidence of adverse reactions that occurred during the first 8 infusions. Adverse reactions that occurred >3% in the SYLVANT arm are presented.

           SYLVANT was also evaluated as a single agent in another hematologic disease in Study 2. Study 2 was an international, multicenter, randomized Phase 2 study of every 4 week infusions comparing SYLVANT and BSC to placebo and BSC. There were 50 patients randomized to the SYLVANT arm at a dose of 15 mg/kg (unapproved dose) and 26 patients randomized to the placebo arm. The median age was 72 years (range 50 to 85), 58% male, 96% White, 1% Asian, 1% Black, and 1% other. The median number of infusions in both arms was 3 (range 1 to 4). The study was stopped early due to a lack of efficacy. Adverse reactions that occurred > 3% in the SYLVANT arm are presented in  Table 4  .

               Long Term Exposure  
 

 The safety of long term administration of SYLVANT to patients with MCD was evaluated in Study 3. Study 3 enrolled patients from the initial dose finding study of SYLVANT with MCD who were benefiting from chronic SYLVANT therapy. SYLVANT was administered at a dose of 11 mg/kg every 3 to 6 weeks. At the time of data cut off 19 patients were enrolled. The median age was 44 years (range 18 - 76), 63% male, 84% Caucasian, 11% Asian, and 5% Black. The median exposure to SYLVANT for these 19 patients was 5.1 years (range 3.4 to 7.2). The most common adverse reaction (> 20%) reported by subjects receiving SYLVANT in this study was upper respiratory tract infection (63%); diarrhea (32%); pain in extremities, arthralgia and fatigue (21% each). No patient was removed from therapy for any reason. There were no deaths. There were no cumulative toxicities identified with prolonged treatment with SYLVANT.



     Anaphylaxis and Infusion Related Reactions  



 Approximately 750 patients have been treated with SYLVANT. Of these, one patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction. Data from 249 patients treated with SYLVANT monotherapy forms the basis of the safety evaluation of infusion related reactions. Infusion related reactions were reported in 4.8% of these patients. Symptoms of infusion reactions consisted of back pain, chest pain or discomfort, nausea and vomiting, flushing, erythema, and palpitations.



     Immunogenicity  



 Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods used. Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive result in a test method may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, drug interference, concomitant medication and the underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to SYLVANT with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. The clinical significance of anti-siltuximab antibodies following treatment with SYLVANT is not known.



 The immunogenicity of siltuximab has been evaluated using antigen-bridging enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay (ECLIA) methods. A total of 411 patients across the clinical studies were evaluated at multiple time points for anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA) responses to siltuximab after treatment with SYLVANT. Following SYLVANT dosing, 0.2% (1/411) of patients tested positive for anti-siltuximab antibodies. Further immunogenicity analyses of the single positive sample revealed a low titer of anti-siltuximab antibodies with non-neutralizing capabilities.



 No evidence of altered toxicity profile was identified in the patient who developed antibodies to siltuximab.

SYLVANT,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  *  Do not administer SYLVANT to patients with severe infections until the infection resolves. (  2  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Monitor patients receiving SYLVANT closely for infections. Institute prompt anti-infective therapy and do not administer SYLVANT until the infection resolves. (  2  ) 
   Concurrent Active Severe Infections 
 *  Vaccinations: Do not administer live vaccines because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the normal immune response to new antigens. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Infusion Related Reactions: Administer SYLVANT in a setting that provides resuscitation equipment, medication, and personnel trained to provide resuscitation. (  5.3  ,  6.1  ) 
 *  Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation: Use with caution in patients who may be at increased risk. Promptly evaluate patients presenting with symptoms that may be associated or suggestive of GI perforation. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Concurrent Active Severe Infections



  Do not administer SYLVANT to patients with severe infections until the infection resolves. SYLVANT may mask signs and symptoms of acute inflammation including suppression of fever and of acute Phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP). Monitor patients receiving SYLVANT closely for infections. Institute prompt anti-infective therapy and do not administer further SYLVANT until the infection resolves.



    5.2 Vaccinations



  Do not administer live vaccines to patients receiving SYLVANT because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the normal immune response to new antigens.



    5.3 Infusion Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity



  Stop the infusion of SYLVANT if the patient develops signs of anaphylaxis. Discontinue further therapy with SYLVANT.



 Stop the infusion if the patient develops a mild to moderate infusion reaction. If the reaction resolves, the SYLVANT infusion may be restarted at a lower infusion rate. Consider medication with antihistamines, acetaminophen, and corticosteroids. Discontinue SYLVANT if the patient does not tolerate the infusion following these interventions [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



 Administer SYLVANT in a setting that provides resuscitation equipment, medication, and personnel trained to provide resuscitation.



    5.4 Gastrointestinal Perforation



  Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation has been reported in clinical trials although not in MCD trials. Use with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for GI perforation. Promptly evaluate patients presenting with symptoms that may be associated or suggestive of GI perforation.

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described in Tables 3-6 below are based on a safety population of 773 previously untreated patients with CLL. Patients were treated with chlorambucil alone, GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil, or rituximab in combination with chlorambucil. The Stage 1 analysis compared GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil vs. chlorambucil alone, and Stage 2 compared GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil vs. rituximab in combination with chlorambucil. Patients received three 1000 mg doses of GAZYVA on the first cycle and a single dose of 1000 mg once every 28 days for 5 additional cycles in combination with chlorambucil (6 cycles of 28 days each in total). In the last 140 patients enrolled, the first dose of GAZYVA was split between day 1 (100 mg) and day 2 (900 mg)  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . In total, 81% of patients received all 6 cycles (of 28 days each) of GAZYVA-based therapy.

               Infusion Reactions:  The incidence of infusion reactions was 65% with the first infusion of GAZYVA. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions was 20% with 7% of patients discontinuing therapy. The incidence of reactions with subsequent infusions was 3% with the second 1000 mg and < 1% thereafter. No Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions were reported beyond the first 1000 mg infused.
 

 Of the first 53 patients receiving GAZYVA on the trial, 47 (89%) experienced an infusion reaction. After this experience, study protocol modifications were made to require pre-medication with a corticosteroid, antihistamine, and acetaminophen. The first dose was also divided into two infusions (100 mg on day 1 and 900 mg on day 2). For the 140 patients for whom these mitigation measures were implemented, 74 patients (53%) experienced a reaction with the first 1000 mg (64 patients on day 1, 3 patients on day 2, and 7 patients on both days) and < 3% thereafter  [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  .



     Neutropenia  : The incidence of neutropenia reported as an adverse reaction was 38% in the GAZYVA treated arm and 32% in the rituximab treated arm, with the incidence of serious adverse events being 1% and < 1%, respectively (  Table 4  ). Cases of late-onset neutropenia (occurring 28 days after completion of treatment or later) were 16% in the GAZYVA treated arm and 12% in the rituximab treated arm.



     Infection:  The incidence of infections was similar between GAZYVA and rituximab treated arms. Thirty-eight percent of patients in the GAZYVA treated arm and 37% in the rituximab treated arm experienced an infection, with Grade 3-4 rates being 11% and 13%, respectively. Fatal events were reported in 1% of patients in both arms.



     Thrombocytopenia  : The overall incidence of thrombocytopenia reported as an adverse reaction was higher in the GAZYVA treated arm (14%) compared to the rituximab treated arm (7%), with the incidence of Grade 3-4 events being 10% and 3%, respectively (  Table 4  ). The difference in incidences between the treatment arms is driven by events occurring during the first cycle. The incidence of thrombocytopenia (all grades) in the first cycle were 11% in the GAZYVA and 3% in the rituximab treated arms, with Grade 3-4 rates being 8% and 2%, respectively. Four percent of patients in the GAZYVA treated arm experienced acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within 24 hours after the GAZYVA infusion).



 The overall incidence of hemorrhagic events and the number of fatal hemorrhagic events were similar between the treatment arms, with 3 in the rituximab and 4 in the GAZYVA treated arms. However, all fatal hemorrhagic events in patients treated with GAZYVA occurred in Cycle 1.



     Tumor Lysis Syndrome:  The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 tumor lysis syndrome was 2% in the GAZYVA treated arm versus 0% in the rituximab treated arm.



     Musculoskeletal Disorders:  Adverse events related to musculoskeletal disorders (all events from the System Organ Class), including pain, have been reported in the GAZYVA treated arm with higher incidence than in the rituximab treated arm (18% vs. 15%).



     Liver Enzyme Elevations  : Hepatic enzyme elevations have occurred in patients who received GAZYVA in clinical trials and had normal baseline hepatic enzyme levels (AST, ALT, and ALP). The events occurred most frequently within 24-48 hours of the first infusion. In some patients, elevations in liver enzymes were observed concurrently with infusion reactions or tumor lysis syndrome. In the pivotal study, there was no clinically meaningful difference in overall hepatotoxicity adverse events between all arms (4% of patients in the GAZYVA treated arm). Medications commonly used to prevent infusion reactions (e.g., acetaminophen) may also be implicated in these events. Monitor liver function tests during treatment, especially during the first cycle. Consider treatment interruption or discontinuation for hepatotoxicity.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  Serum samples from patients with previously untreated CLL were tested during and after treatment for antibodies to GAZYVA. Of the GAZYVA treated patients, 7% (18/271) tested positive for anti-GAZYVA antibodies at one or more time points. Neutralizing activity of anti-GAZYVA antibodies has not been assessed.



 Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods used. Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive result in a test method may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, drug interference, concomitant medication, and the underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to GAZYVA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Clinical significance of anti-GAZYVA antibodies is not known.

   5.1 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation



  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies such as GAZYVA. HBV reactivation has been reported in patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in patients who are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive. Reactivation has also occurred in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive, and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] positive).



 HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels and, in severe cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death.



 Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with GAZYVA. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy.



 Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following treatment with GAZYVA. HBV reactivation has been reported for other CD20-directed cytolytic antibodies following completion of therapy.



 In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while receiving GAZYVA, immediately discontinue GAZYVA and any concomitant chemotherapy and institute appropriate treatment. Resumption of GAZYVA in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming GAZYVA in patients who develop HBV reactivation.



    5.2 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy



  JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which can be fatal, was observed in patients treated with GAZYVA. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new onset or changes to preexisting neurologic manifestations. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Discontinue GAZYVA therapy and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML.



    5.3 Infusion Reactions



  GAZYVA can cause severe and life-threatening infusion reactions. Two thirds of patients experienced a reaction to the first 1000 mg infused of GAZYVA. Infusion reactions can also occur with subsequent infusions. Symptoms may include hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, and respiratory symptoms (e.g., bronchospasm, larynx and throat irritation, wheezing, laryngeal edema). Other common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, flushing, headache, pyrexia, and chills [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Premedicate patients with acetaminophen, antihistamine, and a glucocorticoid .  Institute medical management (e.g., glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, and/or oxygen) for infusion reactions as needed. Closely monitor patients during the entire infusion. Infusion reactions within 24 hours of receiving GAZYVA have occurred [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  .



 For patients with any Grade 4 infusion reactions, including but not limited to anaphylaxis, acute life-threatening respiratory symptoms, or other life-threatening infusion reaction: Stop the GAZYVA infusion. Permanently discontinue GAZYVA therapy.



 For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 infusion reactions: Interrupt GAZYVA for Grade 3 reactions until resolution of symptoms. Interrupt or reduce the rate of the infusion for Grade 1 or 2 reactions and manage symptoms [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  .



  For patients with preexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions, monitor more frequently throughout the infusion and the post-infusion period since they may be at greater risk of experiencing more severe reactions. Hypotension may occur as part of the GAZYVA infusion reaction. Consider withholding antihypertensive treatments for 12 hours prior to, during each GAZYVA infusion, and for the first hour after administration until blood pressure is stable. For patients at increased risk of hypertensive crisis, consider the benefits versus the risks of withholding their antihypertensive medication as is suggested here.  



    5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and/or hyperphosphatemia from Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) can occur within 12-24 hours after the first infusion. Patients with high tumor burden and/or high circulating lymphocyte count (> 25 * 10  9  /L) are at greater risk for TLS and should receive appropriate tumor lysis prophylaxis with anti-hyperuricemics (e.g., allopurinol) and hydration beginning 12-24 hours prior to the infusion of GAZYVA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  For treatment of TLS, correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated.



    5.5 Infections



   Serious bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following GAZYVA therapy. Fatal infections have been reported with GAZYVA. Do not administer GAZYVA to patients with an active infection. Patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections may be at increased risk of infection.  



    5.6 Neutropenia



   GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil caused Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 33% of patients in the trial. Patients with Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia should be monitored frequently with regular laboratory tests until resolution. Anticipate, evaluate, and treat any symptoms or signs of developing infection.  



 Neutropenia can also be of late onset (occurring more than 28 days after completion of treatment) and/or prolonged (lasting longer than 28 days).



 Patients with neutropenia are strongly recommended to receive antimicrobial prophylaxis throughout the treatment period. Antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis should be considered.



    5.7 Thrombocytopenia



   GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil caused Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 10% of patients in the trial. In 4% of patients, GAZYVA caused acute thrombocytopenia occurring within 24 hours after the GAZYVA infusion. Fatal hemorrhagic events during Cycle 1 have also been reported in patients treated with GAZYVA.  



 Monitor all patients frequently for thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events, especially during the first cycle. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, monitor platelet counts more frequently until resolution and consider subsequent dose delays of GAZYVA and chlorambucil or dose reductions of chlorambucil. Transfusion of blood products (i.e., platelet transfusion) may be necessary. Consider withholding concomitant medications which may increase bleeding risk (platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants), especially during the first cycle.



    5.8 Immunization



  The safety and efficacy of immunization with live or attenuated viral vaccines during or following GAZYVA therapy has not been studied. Immunization with live virus vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B-cell recovery.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions with Monotherapy and with Add-On Combination Therapy  

  In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of 24-weeks duration, patients were treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg daily, ONGLYZA 5 mg daily, and placebo. Three 24-week, placebo-controlled, add-on combination therapy trials were also conducted: one with metformin, one with a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone), and one with glyburide. In these three trials, patients were randomized to add-on therapy with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg daily, ONGLYZA 5 mg daily, or placebo. A saxagliptin 10 mg treatment arm was included in one of the monotherapy trials and in the add-on combination trial with metformin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage.



 In a prespecified pooled analysis of the 24-week data (regardless of glycemic rescue) from the two monotherapy trials, the add-on to metformin trial, the add-on to thiazolidinedione (TZD) trial, and the add-on to glyburide trial, the overall incidence of adverse events in patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg was similar to placebo (72% and 72.2% versus 70.6%, respectively). Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, ONGLYZA 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse events (reported in at least 2 patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with ONGLYZA 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). The adverse reactions in this pooled analysis reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in >=5% of patients treated with ONGLYZA 5 mg, and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are shown in Table 1.



 Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled TrialsThe 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin, thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. Reported in >=5% of Patients Treated with ONGLYZA 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo 
                                                          Number (%) of Patients          
                                                          ONGLYZA 5 mg    N=882            Placebo    N=799     
  
  Upper respiratory tract infection                      68 (7.7)                         61 (7.6)          
  Urinary tract infection                                60 (6.8)                         49 (6.1)          
  Headache                                               57 (6.5)                         47 (5.9)          
         In patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, headache (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate >=5% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo.
 

 In this pooled analysis, adverse reactions that were reported in >=2% of patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg or ONGLYZA 5 mg and >=1% more frequently compared to placebo included: sinusitis (2.9% and 2.6% versus 1.6%, respectively), abdominal pain (2.4% and 1.7% versus 0.5%), gastroenteritis (1.9% and 2.3% versus 0.9%), and vomiting (2.2% and 2.3% versus 1.3%).



 In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for ONGLYZA 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in study drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide.



 The incidence rate of fractures was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for ONGLYZA (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received ONGLYZA did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of ONGLYZA on bone.



 An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to ONGLYZA is not known.



     Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment  

  ONGLYZA 2.5 mg was compared to placebo in a 12-week trial in 170 patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate or severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between ONGLYZA and placebo.



     Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin  

  In the add-on to insulin trial [  see  Clinical Studies (14.2)    ], the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between ONGLYZA and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [  see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].



     Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Metformin in Treatment-Naive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes  

  Table 2 shows the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in >=5% of patients participating in an additional 24-week, active-controlled trial of coadministered ONGLYZA and metformin in treatment-naive patients.

  Nasopharyngitis              22 (6.9)                                              13 (4.0)                
             Hypoglycemia  
   Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia.



 In the add-on to glyburide study, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg (13.3% and 14.6%) versus placebo (10.1%). The incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia in this study, defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia accompanied by a fingerstick glucose value of <=50 mg/dL, was 2.4% and 0.8% for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg and 0.7% for placebo [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ]. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively, 7.8% and 5.8% versus 5% given as add-on therapy to metformin, and 4.1% and 2.7% versus 3.8% given as add-on therapy to TZD. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in treatment-naive patients given ONGLYZA 5 mg plus metformin and 4% in patients given metformin alone.



 In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with ONGLYZA 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with ONGLYZA 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose <=50 mg/dL) was reported in none of the ONGLYZA-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p<0.0001).



 During 12 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 20% among patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and 22% among patients treated with placebo. Four ONGLYZA-treated patients (4.7%) and three placebo-treated patients (3.5%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick glucose <=50 mg/dL).



 In the add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for ONGLYZA 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose <=50 mg/dL) was higher with ONGLYZA 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%).



 In the add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for ONGLYZA 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed hypoglycemia was reported in 1.6% of the ONGLYZA-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [  see      Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ].



     Hypersensitivity Reactions  

  Hypersensitivity-related events, such as urticaria and facial edema in the 5-study pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, ONGLYZA 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received ONGLYZA required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One ONGLYZA-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to generalized urticaria and facial edema.



     Infections  

  In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for ONGLYZA to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of tuberculosis among the 4959 ONGLYZA-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of tuberculosis among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of tuberculosis. None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with ONGLYZA until report of tuberculosis ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had lymphopenia prior to initiation of ONGLYZA that remained stable throughout ONGLYZA treatment. The final patient had an isolated lymphocyte count below normal approximately four months prior to the report of tuberculosis. There have been no spontaneous reports of tuberculosis associated with ONGLYZA use. Causality has not been estimated and there are too few cases to date to determine whether tuberculosis is related to ONGLYZA use.



 There has been one case of a potential opportunistic infection in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in an ONGLYZA-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne fatal salmonella sepsis after approximately 600 days of ONGLYZA therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of opportunistic infections associated with ONGLYZA use.



     Vital Signs  

  No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with ONGLYZA.



     Laboratory Tests  

    Absolute Lymphocyte Counts  

  There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with ONGLYZA. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with ONGLYZA 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical studies. Similar effects were observed when ONGLYZA 5 mg was given in initial combination with metformin compared to metformin alone. There was no difference observed for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count <=750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to ONGLYZA although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of ONGLYZA. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage.



 The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of ONGLYZA on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ONGLYZA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

ONGLYZA,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Acute Pancreatitis (postmarketing reports): If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue ONGLYZA.  (5.1)   
 *     Hypoglycemia: In add-on to sulfonylurea, add-on to insulin, and add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea trials, confirmed hypoglycemia was more common in patients treated with ONGLYZA compared to placebo. When used with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.  (5.2  ,  6.1)   
 *     Hypersensitivity-Related Events (e.g., urticaria, facial edema): More common in patients treated with ONGLYZA than in patients treated with placebo; and postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Promptly discontinue ONGLYZA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes.  (5.3  ,  6.1  ,  6.2)   
 *     Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. (  5.4  ) 
 *    There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with ONGLYZA or any other antidiabetic drug.  (5.5)   
    
 

   5.1 Pancreatitis



  There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking ONGLYZA. After initiation of ONGLYZA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, ONGLYZA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using ONGLYZA.



    5.2 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Sulfonylurea or Insulin



  When ONGLYZA was used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with ONGLYZA [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)    ].



    5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with ONGLYZA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with ONGLYZA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue ONGLYZA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ].



 Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with ONGLYZA.



    5.4 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia



  There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP4 inhibitor. Consider DPP4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.



    5.5 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with ONGLYZA or any other antidiabetic drug.

  6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be compared directly to rates from clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.



 Adverse reactions were evaluated for 1050 patients treated with SIVEXTRO and 662 patients treated with the comparator antibacterial drug in two Phase 2 and two Phase 3 clinical trials. The median age of patients treated with SIVEXTRO in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials was 42 years, ranging between 17 and 86 years old. Patients treated with SIVEXTRO were predominantly male (65%) and White (82%).



     Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  



 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 12/662 (1.8%) of patients treated with SIVEXTRO and in 13/662 (2.0%) of patients treated with the comparator. SIVEXTRO was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 3/662 (0.5%) of patients and the comparator was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 6/662 (0.9%) of patients.



     Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with SIVEXTRO were nausea (8%), headache (6%), diarrhea (4%), vomiting (3%), and dizziness (2%). The median time of onset of adverse reactions was 5 days for both SIVEXTRO and linezolid with 12% occurring on the second day of treatment in both treatment groups.



 Table 2 lists selected adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients treated with SIVEXTRO in clinical trials.

 Phase 1 studies conducted in healthy adults exposed to SIVEXTRO for 21 days showed a possible dose and duration effect on hematologic parameters beyond 6 days of treatment. In the Phase 3 trials, clinically significant changes in these parameters were generally similar for both treatment arms (see  Table 3  ).



     Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy  



 Peripheral and optic neuropathy have been described in patients treated with another member of the oxazolidinone class for longer than 28 days. In Phase 3 trials, reported adverse reactions for peripheral neuropathy and optic nerve disorders were similar between both treatment arms (peripheral neuropathy 1.2% vs. 0.6% for tedizolid phosphate and linezolid, respectively; optic nerve disorders 0.3% vs. 0.2%, respectively). No data are available for patients exposed to SIVEXTRO for longer than 6 days.

SIVEXTRO,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Patients with neutropenia: The safety and efficacy of SIVEXTRO in patients with neutropenia (neutrophil counts <1000 cells/mm  3  ) have not been adequately evaluated. In an animal model of infection, the antibacterial activity of SIVEXTRO was reduced in the absence of granulocytes. Consider alternative therapies in neutropenic patients. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Patients with Neutropenia



  The safety and efficacy of SIVEXTRO in patients with neutropenia (neutrophil counts <1000 cells/mm  3  ) have not been adequately evaluated. In an animal model of infection, the antibacterial activity of SIVEXTRO was reduced in the absence of granulocytes [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ]. Alternative therapies should be considered when treating patients with neutropenia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection.



    5.2 Clostridium difficile  -Associated Diarrhea



   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents including SIVEXTRO, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile  should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



    5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria



  Prescribing SIVEXTRO in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

PREPOPIK,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (>1%) are nausea, headache and vomiting (abdominal bloating, distension, pain/cramping, and watery diarrhea not requiring an intervention were not collected) (  6.1  )  To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ferring at 1-888-FERRING (1-888-337-7464) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch.    



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In randomized, multicenter, controlled clinical trials, nausea, headache, and vomiting were the most common adverse reactions (>1%) following Prepopik  (r)  administration. The patients were not blinded to the study drug. Since abdominal bloating, distension, pain/cramping, and watery diarrhea are known to occur in response to colon cleansing preparations, these effects were documented as adverse events in the clinical trials only if they required medical intervention (such as a change in study drug or led to study discontinuation, therapeutic or diagnostic procedures, met the criteria for a serious adverse event), or showed clinically significant worsening during the study that was not in the frame of the usual clinical course, as determined by the investigator.



 Prepopik  (r)  was compared for colon cleansing effectiveness with a preparation containing two liters (2L) of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution (PEG + E) and two 5-mg bisacodyl tablets, all administered the day before the procedure. Table 1 displays the most common adverse reactions in Study 1 and Study 2 for the Prepopik  (r)  Split-Dose and Day-Before dosing regimens, respectively, each as compared to the comparator preparation.

               Electrolyte Abnormalities  
 

 In general, Prepopik  (r)  was associated with numerically higher rates of abnormal electrolyte shifts on the day of colonoscopy compared to the preparation containing 2L of PEG + E plus two * 5-mg bisacodyl tablets (Table 2). These shifts were transient in nature and numerically similar between treatment arms at the Day 30 visit.

              6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following foreign spontaneous reports have been identified during use of formulations similar to Prepopik  (r)  . Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     Allergic reactions  



 Cases of hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, and purpura have been reported.



     Electrolyte abnormalities  



 There have been reports of hypokalemia, hyponatremia and hypermagnesemia with the use of Prepopik  (r)  for colon preparation prior to colonoscopy.



     Gastrointestinal:  



 Abdominal pain, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, and proctalgia have been reported with the use of Prepopik  (r)  for colon preparation prior to colonoscopy. There have been isolated reports of reversible aphthoid ileal ulcers. Ischemic colitis has been reported with the use of Prepopik  (r)  for colon preparation prior to colonoscopy. However, a causal relationship between these ischemic colitis cases and the use of Prepopik  (r)  has not been established.



     Neurologic,  



 There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures associated with and without hyponatremia in epileptic patients.

PREPOPIK,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, arrhythmia, seizures, and renal impairment: Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after use (  5.1  ,  5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.4  ) 
 *   Risks in patients with renal insufficiency or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function: Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider testing (  5.3  ) 
 *   Mucosal ulcerations: Consider potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease (  5.5  ) 
 *   Suspected GI obstruction or perforation: Rule out diagnosis before administration (  4  ,  5.6  ) 
 *   Patients at risk for aspiration: Observe during administration (  5.7  ) 
 *   Not for direct ingestion: Dissolve and take with additional water (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities



  Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of Prepopik  (r)  . Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking Prepopik  (r)  , consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) and treat accordingly. Approximately 20% of patients in both arms (Prepopik  (r)  , 2L of PEG + E plus two * 5-mg bisacodyl tablets) of clinical trials of Prepopik  (r)  had orthostatic changes (changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate) on the day of colonoscopy. In clinical trials orthostatic changes were documented out to seven days post colonoscopy. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  



 Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias or seizures and renal impairment. Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before treatment with Prepopik  (r)  . In addition, use caution when prescribing Prepopik  (r)  for patients who have conditions or who are using medications that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or that may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmia, and renal impairment.



    5.2 Seizures



  There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures with the use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.



 Use caution when prescribing Prepopik  (r)  for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  



    5.3 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment



  As in other magnesium containing bowel preparations, use caution when prescribing Prepopik  (r)  for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). These patients may be at increased risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of Prepopik  (r)  . Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients. In patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), accumulation of magnesium in plasma may occur.



    5.4 Cardiac Arrhythmias



  There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing Prepopik  (r)  for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.



    5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis



  Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of additional stimulant laxatives with Prepopik  (r)  may increase this risk. The potential for mucosal ulcerations should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  



    5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease



  If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering Prepopik  (r)  . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.



    5.7 Aspiration



  Patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of Prepopik  (r)  . Use with caution in these patients.



    5.8 Not for Direct Ingestion

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of OFEV was evaluated in over 1000 IPF patients with over 200 patients exposed to OFEV for more than 2 years in clinical trials.



 OFEV was studied in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week trials. In the phase 2 (Study 1) and phase 3 (Studies 2 and 3) trials, 723 patients with IPF received OFEV 150 mg twice daily and 508 patients received placebo. The median duration of exposure was 10 months for patients treated with OFEV and 11 months for patients treated with placebo. Subjects ranged in age from 42 to 89 years (median age of 67 years). Most patients were male (79%) and Caucasian (60%).



 The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with OFEV, more than placebo, were bronchitis (1.2% vs. 0.8%) and myocardial infarction (1.5% vs. 0.4%). The most common adverse events leading to death in patients treated with OFEV, more than placebo, were pneumonia (0.7% vs. 0.6%), lung neoplasm malignant (0.3% vs. 0%), and myocardial infarction (0.3% vs. 0.2%). In the predefined category of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including MI, fatal events were reported in 0.6% of OFEV-treated patients and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients.



 Adverse reactions leading to permanent dose reductions were reported in 16% of OFEV-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reaction that led to permanent dose reduction in the patients treated with OFEV was diarrhea (11%).



 Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were reported in 21% of OFEV-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in OFEV-treated patients were diarrhea (5%), nausea (2%), and decreased appetite (2%).



 The most common adverse reactions with an incidence of >=5% and more frequent in the OFEV than placebo treatment group are listed in Table 1.

OFEV,warnings and precautions,"    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Elevated liver enzymes: ALT, AST, and bilirubin elevations have occurred with OFEV. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before and during treatment. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. (  2.1  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Gastrointestinal disorders: Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting have occurred with OFEV. Treat patients at first signs with adequate hydration and antidiarrheal medicine (e.g., loperamide) or anti-emetics. Discontinue OFEV if severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting persists despite symptomatic treatment. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Embryofetal toxicity: Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Arterial thromboembolic events have been reported. Use caution when treating patients at higher cardiovascular risk including known coronary artery disease. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Bleeding events have been reported. Use OFEV in patients with known bleeding risk only if anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported. Use OFEV with caution when treating patients with recent abdominal surgery. Discontinue OFEV in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. Only use OFEV in patients with known risk of gastrointestinal perforation if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Elevated Liver Enzymes



  The safety and efficacy of OFEV has not been studied in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) or severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Treatment with OFEV is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  



 In clinical trials, administration of OFEV was associated with elevations of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALKP, GGT). Liver enzyme increases were reversible with dose modification or interruption and not associated with clinical signs or symptoms of liver injury. The majority (94%) of patients with ALT and/or AST elevations had elevations <5 times ULN. Administration of OFEV was also associated with elevations of bilirubin. The majority (95%) of patients with bilirubin elevations had elevations <2 times ULN [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  



 Conduct liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to treatment with OFEV, monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Dosage modifications or interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.3  )].  



    5.2 Gastrointestinal Disorders



   Diarrhea  Diarrhea was the most frequent gastrointestinal event reported in 62% versus 18% of patients treated with OFEV and placebo, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  In most patients, the event was of mild to moderate intensity and occurred within the first 3 months of treatment. Diarrhea led to permanent dose reduction in 11% of patients treated with OFEV compared to 0 placebo-treated patients. Diarrhea led to discontinuation of OFEV in 5% of the patients compared to <1% of placebo-treated patients.



 Dosage modifications or treatment interruptions may be necessary in patients with adverse reactions of diarrhea. Treat diarrhea at first signs with adequate hydration and antidiarrheal medication (e.g., loperamide), and consider treatment interruption if diarrhea continues [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )].  OFEV treatment may be resumed at the full dosage (150 mg twice daily), or at the reduced dosage (100 mg twice daily), which subsequently may be increased to the full dosage. If severe diarrhea persists despite symptomatic treatment, discontinue treatment with OFEV.



  Nausea and Vomiting  Nausea was reported in 24% versus 7% and vomiting was reported in 12% versus 3% of patients treated with OFEV and placebo, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . In most patients, these events were of mild to moderate intensity. Nausea led to discontinuation of OFEV in 2% of patients. Vomiting led to discontinuation of OFEV in 1% of the patients.



 For nausea or vomiting that persists despite appropriate supportive care including anti-emetic therapy, dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  . OFEV treatment may be resumed at the full dosage (150 mg twice daily), or at the reduced dosage (100 mg twice daily), which subsequently may be increased to the full dosage. If severe nausea or vomiting does not resolve, discontinue treatment with OFEV.



    5.3 Embryofetal Toxicity



  OFEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Nintedanib was teratogenic and embryofetocidal in rats and rabbits at less than and approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in adults (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 2.5 and 15 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). If OFEV is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking OFEV, the patient should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with OFEV and to use adequate contraception during treatment and at least 3 months after the last dose of OFEV [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )].  



    5.4 Arterial Thromboembolic Events



  Arterial thromboembolic events have been reported in patients taking OFEV. In clinical trials, arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with OFEV and 0.8% of placebo-treated patients. Myocardial infarction was the most common adverse reaction under arterial thromboembolic events, occurring in 1.5% of OFEV-treated patients compared to 0.4% of placebo-treated patients.



 Use caution when treating patients at higher cardiovascular risk including known coronary artery disease. Consider treatment interruption in patients who develop signs or symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia.



    5.5 Risk of Bleeding



  Based on the mechanism of action (VEGFR inhibition), OFEV may increase the risk of bleeding. In clinical trials, bleeding events were reported in 10% of patients treated with OFEV and in 7% of patients treated with placebo.



 Use OFEV in patients with known risk of bleeding only if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk.



    5.6 Gastrointestinal Perforation



  Based on the mechanism of action, OFEV may increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation. In clinical trials, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 0.3% of patients treated with OFEV, compared to 0 cases in the placebo-treated patients.



 Use caution when treating patients who have had recent abdominal surgery. Discontinue therapy with OFEV in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. Only use OFEV in patients with known risk of gastrointestinal perforation if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 ZONTIVITY was evaluated for safety in 13,186 patients, including 2,187 patients treated for more than 3 years, in the Phase 3 study TRA 2 degrees P TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events). The overall study population, patients who had evidence or a history of atherosclerosis involving the coronary (post-MI), cerebral (ischemic stroke), or peripheral vascular (documented history of PAD) systems, was treated once a day with ZONTIVITY (n=13,186) or placebo (n=13,166). Patients randomized to ZONTIVITY received treatment for a median of 2.3 years.



 The adverse events in the ZONTIVITY-treated (n=10,059) and placebo-treated (n=10,049) post-MI or PAD patients with no history of stroke or TIA are shown below  [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



     Bleeding  



 GUSTO severe bleeding was defined as fatal, intracranial, or bleeding with hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention; GUSTO moderate bleeding was defined as bleeding requiring transfusion of whole blood or packed red blood cells without hemodynamic compromise. (GUSTO: Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Arteries.)



 The results for the bleeding endpoints in the post-MI or PAD patients without a history of stroke or TIA are shown in Table 1. ZONTIVITY increased GUSTO moderate or severe bleeding by 55%.

            The effects of ZONTIVITY on bleeding were examined in a number of subsets based on demographic and other baseline characteristics. Many of these are shown in Figure 1. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses.

       In TRA 2 degrees P, 367 post-MI or PAD patients without a history of stroke or TIA underwent CABG surgery. Study investigators were encouraged not to discontinue treatment with study drug (i.e., ZONTIVITY or placebo) prior to surgery. Approximately 12.3% of patients discontinued ZONTIVITY more than 30 days prior to CABG. The relative risk for GUSTO moderate or severe bleeding was approximately 1.2 on ZONTIVITY vs. placebo.
 

 Bleeding events that occurred on ZONTIVITY were treated in the same manner as for other antiplatelet agents.



  Figure 1     Use in Patients with History of Stroke, TIA, or ICH  



 In the TRA 2 degrees P study, patients with a history of ischemic stroke had a higher rate for ICH on ZONTIVITY than on placebo. ZONTIVITY is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke, TIA, or ICH  [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



     Other Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions other than bleeding were evaluated in 19,632 patients treated with ZONTIVITY [13,186 patients in the TRA 2 degrees P study and 6,446 patients in the TRACER (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist for Clinical Event Reduction in Acute Coronary Syndrome) study]. Adverse events other than bleeding that occurred at a rate that was at least 2% in the ZONTIVITY group and also 10% greater than the rate in the placebo group are shown in Table 2.

ZONTIVITY,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Like other antiplatelet agents, ZONTIVITY increases the risk of bleeding. (  5.1  )

   5.1 General Risk of Bleeding



  Antiplatelet agents, including ZONTIVITY, increase the risk of bleeding, including ICH and fatal bleeding [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 ZONTIVITY increases the risk of bleeding in proportion to the patient's underlying bleeding risk. Consider the underlying risk of bleeding before initiating ZONTIVITY. General risk factors for bleeding include older age, low body weight, reduced renal or hepatic function, history of bleeding disorders, and use of certain concomitant medications (e.g., anticoagulants, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) increases the risk of bleeding [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Avoid concomitant use of warfarin or other anticoagulants.



 Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), or other surgical procedures.



 Withholding ZONTIVITY for a brief period will not be useful in managing an acute bleeding event because of its long half-life. There is no known treatment to reverse the antiplatelet effect of ZONTIVITY. Significant inhibition of platelet aggregation remains 4 weeks after discontinuation [see     Overdosage (10)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2  ,  12.3)  ].  



    5.2 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors or Inducers



  Strong CYP3A inhibitors increase and inducers decrease ZONTIVITY exposure. Avoid concomitant use of ZONTIVITY with strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  In the BELVIQ placebo-controlled clinical database of trials of at least one year in duration, of 6888 patients (3451 BELVIQ vs. 3437 placebo; age range 18-66 years, 79.3% women, 66.6% Caucasians, 19.2% Blacks, 11.8% Hispanics, 2.4% other, 7.4% type 2 diabetics), a total of 1969 patients were exposed to BELVIQ 10 mg twice daily for 1 year and 426 patients were exposed for 2 years.



 In clinical trials of at least one year in duration, 8.6% of patients treated with BELVIQ prematurely discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared with 6.7% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation more often among BELVIQ treated patients than placebo were headache (1.3% vs. 0.8%), depression (0.9% vs. 0.5%) and dizziness (0.7% vs. 0.2%).



       Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most common adverse reactions for non-diabetic patients (greater than 5% and more commonly than placebo) treated with BELVIQ compared to placebo were headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, and constipation. The most common adverse reactions for diabetic patients were hypoglycemia, headache, back pain, cough, and fatigue. Adverse reactions that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients and were more frequently reported by patients taking BELVIQ compared to placebo are summarized in Table 2 (non-diabetic subjects) and Table 3 (subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus).

               Other Adverse Reactions  
 

   Serotonin-associated Adverse Reactions  



 SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs were excluded from the BELVIQ trials. Triptans and dextromethorphan were permitted: 2% and 15%, respectively, of patients without diabetes and 1% and 12%, respectively, of patients with type 2 diabetes experienced concomitant use at some point during the trials. Two patients treated with BELVIQ in the clinical program experienced a constellation of symptoms and signs consistent with serotonergic excess, including one patient on concomitant dextromethorphan who reported an event of serotonin syndrome. Some symptoms of possible serotonergic etiology that are included in the criteria for serotonin syndrome were reported by patients treated with BELVIQ and placebo during clinical trials of at least 1 year in duration. In both groups, chills were the most frequent of these events (1.0% vs. 0.2%, respectively), followed by tremor (0.3% vs. 0.2%), confusional state (0.2% vs. less than 0.1%), disorientation (0.1% vs. 0.1%) and hyperhidrosis (0.1% vs. 0.2%). Because serotonin syndrome has a very low incidence, an association between BELVIQ and serotonin syndrome cannot be excluded on the basis of clinical trial results [  see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )  ].



   Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes  



 In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person occurred in 4 (1.6%) of BELVIQ-treated patients and in 1 (0.4%) placebo-treated patient. Of these 4 BELVIQ-treated patients, all were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea (with or without metformin). BELVIQ has not been studied in patients taking insulin. Hypoglycemia defined as blood sugar less than or equal to 65 mg/dL and with symptoms occurred in 19 (7.4%) BELVIQ-treated patients and 16 (6.3%) placebo-treated patients.



   Cognitive Impairment  



 In clinical trials of at least 1-year duration, adverse reactions related to cognitive impairment (e.g., difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory, and confusion) occurred in 2.3% of patients taking BELVIQ and 0.7% of patients taking placebo.



   Psychiatric Disorders  



 Psychiatric disorders leading to hospitalization or drug withdrawal occurred more frequently in patients treated with BELVIQ (2.2%) as compared to placebo (1.1%) in non-diabetic patients.



   Euphoria.  In short-term studies with healthy individuals, the incidence of euphoric mood following supratherapeutic doses of BELVIQ (40 and 60 mg) was increased as compared to placebo [  see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9.2  )  ]. In clinical trials of at least 1-year duration in obese patients, euphoria was observed in 0.17% of patients taking BELVIQ and 0.03% taking placebo.



   Depression and Suicidality.  In trials of at least one year in duration, reports of depression/mood problems occurred in 2.6% BELVIQ-treated vs. 2.4% placebo-treated and suicidal ideation occurred in 0.6% BELVIQ-treated vs. 0.4% placebo-treated patients. 1.3% of BELVIQ patients vs. 0.6% of placebo patients discontinued drug due to depression-, mood-, or suicidal ideation-related events.



   Laboratory Abnormalities  



   Lymphocyte and Neutrophil Counts.  In clinical trials of at least 1-year duration, lymphocyte counts were below the lower limit of normal in 12.2% of patients taking BELVIQ and 9.0% taking placebo, and neutrophil counts were low in 5.6% and 4.3%, respectively.



   Hemoglobin.  In clinical trials of at least 1-year duration, 10.4% of patients taking BELVIQ and 9.3% taking placebo had hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal at some point during the trials.



   Prolactin.  In clinical trials, elevations of prolactin greater than the upper limit of normal, two times the upper limit of normal, and five times the upper limit of normal, occurred in 6.7%, 1.7%, and 0.1% of BELVIQ-treated patients and 4.8%, 0.8%, and 0.0% of placebo-treated patients, respectively.



   Eye disorders  .



 More patients on BELVIQ reported an eye disorder than patients on placebo in clinical trials of patients without diabetes (4.5% vs. 3.0%) and with type 2 diabetes (6.3% vs. 1.6%). In the population without diabetes, events of blurred vision, dry eye, and visual impairment occurred in BELVIQ-treated patients at an incidence greater than that of placebo. In the population with type 2 diabetes, visual disorders, conjunctival infections, irritations, and inflammations, ocular sensation disorders, and cataract conditions occurred in BELVIQ-treated patients at an incidence greater than placebo.



       Echocardiographic Safety Assessments  



 The possible occurrence of regurgitant cardiac valve disease was prospectively evaluated in 7794 patients in three clinical trials of at least one year in duration, 3451 of whom took BELVIQ 10 mg twice daily. The primary echocardiographic safety parameter was the proportion of patients who developed echocardiographic criteria of mild or greater aortic insufficiency and/or moderate or greater mitral insufficiency from baseline to 1 year. At 1 year, 2.4% of patients who received BELVIQ and 2.0% of patients who received placebo developed valvular regurgitation. The relative risk for valvulopathy with BELVIQ is summarized in Table 4. BELVIQ was not studied in patients with congestive heart failure or hemodynamically-significant valvular heart disease [  see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ].

   5.1 Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like Reactions



  BELVIQ is a serotonergic drug. The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported during use of serotonergic drugs, including, but not limited to, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), bupropion, triptans, dietary supplements such as St. John's Wort and tryptophan, drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]), dextromethorphan, lithium, tramadol, antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists, particularly when used in combination [ see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )  ].



 Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form, can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.



 The safety of BELVIQ when coadministered with other serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, or drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, including MAOIs, has not been systematically evaluated and has not been established.



 If concomitant administration of BELVIQ with an agent that affects the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, extreme caution and careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with BELVIQ and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) and Drug Interactions (  7.1  )  ].



    5.2 Valvular Heart Disease



  Regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral and/or aortic valves, has been reported in patients who took serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2Breceptor agonist activity. The etiology of the regurgitant valvular disease is thought to be activation of 5-HT2Breceptors on cardiac interstitial cells. At therapeutic concentrations, BELVIQ is selective for 5-HT2Creceptors as compared to 5-HT2Breceptors. In clinical trials of 1-year duration, 2.4% of patients receiving BELVIQ and 2.0% of patients receiving placebo developed echocardiographic criteria for valvular regurgitation at one year (mild or greater aortic regurgitation and/or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation): none of these patients was symptomatic [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )  ].



 BELVIQ has not been studied in patients with congestive heart failure or hemodynamically-significant valvular heart disease. Preliminary data suggest that 5HT2Breceptors may be overexpressed in congestive heart failure, Therefore, BELVIQ should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure.



 BELVIQ should not be used in combination with serotonergic and dopaminergic drugs that are potent 5-HT2Breceptor agonists and are known to increase the risk for cardiac valvulopathy (e.g., cabergoline).



 Patients who develop signs or symptoms of valvular heart disease, including dyspnea, dependent edema, congestive heart failure, or a new cardiac murmur while being treated with BELVIQ should be evaluated and discontinuation of BELVIQ should be considered.



    5.3 Cognitive Impairment



  In clinical trials of at least one year in duration, impairments in attention and memory were reported adverse reactions associated with 1.9% of patients treated with BELVIQ and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo, and led to discontinuation in 0.3% and 0.1% of these patients, respectively. Other reported adverse reactions associated with BELVIQ in clinical trials included confusion, somnolence, and fatigue [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



 Since BELVIQ has the potential to impair cognitive function, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that BELVIQ therapy does not affect them adversely [ see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )  ].



    5.4 Psychiatric Disorders



  Events of euphoria, hallucination, and dissociation were seen with BELVIQ at supratherapeutic doses in short-term studies [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9.2  ), and Overdosage (  10  )  ]. In clinical trials of at least 1-year in duration, 6 patients (0.2%) treated with BELVIQ developed euphoria, as compared with 1 patient (<0.1%) treated with placebo. Doses of BELVIQ should not exceed 10 mg twice a day.



 Some drugs that target the central nervous system have been associated with depression or suicidal ideation. Patients treated with BELVIQ should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Discontinue BELVIQ in patients who experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



    5.5 Potential Risk of Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on Anti-diabetic Therapy



  Weight loss may increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and/or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas); hypoglycemia was observed in clinical trials with BELVIQ. BELVIQ has not been studied in combination with insulin. Measurement of blood glucose levels prior to starting BELVIQ and during BELVIQ treatment is recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes. Decreases in medication doses for anti-diabetic medications which are non-glucose-dependent should be considered to mitigate the risk of hypoglycemia. If a patient develops hypoglycemia after starting BELVIQ, appropriate changes should be made to the anti-diabetic drug regimen [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



    5.6 Priapism



  Priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) is a potential effect of 5-HT2Creceptor agonism.



 If not treated promptly, priapism can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Men who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention.



 BELVIQ should be used with caution in men who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in men with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). There is limited experience with the combination of BELVIQ and medication indicated for erectile dysfunction (e.g., phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors). Therefore, the combination of BELVIQ and these medications should be used with caution.



    5.7 Heart Rate Decreases



  In clinical trials of at least 1-year in duration, the mean change in heart rate (HR) was -1.2 beats per minute (bpm) in BELVIQ and -0.4 bpm in placebo-treated patients without diabetes and -2.0 beats per minute (bpm) in BELVIQ and -0.4 bpm in placebo-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. The incidence of HR less than 50 bpm was 5.3% in BELVIQ and 3.2% in placebo-treated patients without diabetes and 3.6% in BELVIQ and 2.0% in placebo-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. In the combined population, adverse reactions of bradycardia occurred in 0.3% of BELVIQ and 0.1% of placebo-treated patients. Use with caution in patients with bradycardia or a history of heart block greater than first degree.



    5.8 Hematological Changes



  In clinical trials of at least one year in duration, adverse reactions of decreases in white blood cell count (including leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and decreased white cell count) were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with BELVIQ as compared to 0.2% of patients treated with placebo. Adverse reactions of decreases in red blood cell count (including anemia and decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit) were reported by 1.3% of patients treated with BELVIQ as compared to 1.2% treated with placebo [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ]. Consider periodic monitoring of complete blood count during treatment with BELVIQ.



    5.9 Prolactin Elevation



  Lorcaserin moderately elevates prolactin levels. In a subset of placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least one year in duration, elevations of prolactin greater than the upper limit of normal, two times the upper limit of normal, and five times the upper limit of normal, measured both before and 2 hours after dosing, occurred in 6.7%, 1.7%, and 0.1% of BELVIQ-treated patients and 4.8%, 0.8%, and 0.0% of placebo-treated patients, respectively [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ]. Prolactin should be measured when symptoms and signs of prolactin excess are suspected (e.g., galactorrhea, gynecomastia). There was one patient treated with BELVIQ who developed a prolactinoma during the trial. The relationship of BELVIQ to the prolactinoma in this patient is unknown.



    5.10 Pulmonary Hypertension



  Certain centrally-acting weight loss agents that act on the serotonin system have been associated with pulmonary hypertension, a rare but lethal disease. Because of the low incidence of this disease, the clinical trial experience with BELVIQ is inadequate to determine if BELVIQ increases the risk for pulmonary hypertension.

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 One case of RPLS occurred during clinical trials  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ].  



       Infections    



 In the placebo-controlled period of clinical studies of psoriasis subjects (average follow-up of 12.6 weeks for placebo-treated subjects and 13.4 weeks for STELARA  (r)  -treated subjects), 27% of STELARA  (r)  -treated subjects reported infections (1.39 per subject-year of follow-up) compared with 24% of placebo-treated subjects (1.21 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of STELARA  (r)  -treated subjects (0.01 per subject-year of follow-up) and in 0.4% of placebo-treated subjects (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up)  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



 In the controlled and non-controlled portions of psoriasis clinical trials (median follow up of 3.2 years), representing 8998 subject-years of exposure, 72.3% of STELARA  (r)  -treated subjects reported infections (0.87 per subject-years of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 2.8% of subjects (0.01 per subject-years of follow-up).



       Malignancies    



 In the controlled and non-controlled portions of psoriasis clinical trials (median follow up of 3.2 years, representing 8998 subject-years of exposure), 1.7% of STELARA  (r)  -treated subjects reported malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (0.60 per hundred subject-years of follow-up). Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% of STELARA  (r)  -treated subjects (0.52 per hundred subject-years of follow-up)  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  . The most frequently observed malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the clinical trials were: prostate, melanoma, colorectal and breast. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer in STELARA  (r)  -treated patients during the controlled and uncontrolled portions of studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender and race).  1  



     Psoriatic Arthritis Clinical Studies  



 The safety of STELARA  (r)  was assessed in 927 patients in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The overall safety profile of STELARA  (r)  in patients with PsA was consistent with the safety profile seen in psoriasis clinical studies. A higher incidence of arthralgia, nausea, and dental infections was observed in STELARA  (r)  -treated patients when compared with placebo-treated patients (3%  vs.  1% for arthralgia and 3% vs. 1% for nausea; 1% vs. 0.6% for dental infections) in the placebo-controlled portions of the PsA clinical trials.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  Approximately 6% of patients treated with STELARA  (r)  in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical studies developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen. No ustekinumab-related serious hypersensitivity reactions were observed in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical trials. In psoriasis studies, the majority of patients who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies.



 The data above reflect the percentage of subjects whose test results were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Post-marketing Experience

  Adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use with STELARA  (r)  . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to STELARA  (r)  exposure.

   5.1 Infections



  STELARA  (r)  may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections. Serious bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were observed in subjects receiving STELARA  (r)   [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 STELARA  (r)  should not be given to patients with any clinically important active infection. STELARA  (r)  should not be administered until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. Exercise caution when considering the use of STELARA  (r)  in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection.



  Serious infections requiring hospitalization occurred in the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis development programs. In the psoriasis program, serious infections included diverticulitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, viral infections, gastroenteritis and urinary tract infections. In the psoriatic arthritis program, serious infections included cholecystitis.  



    5.2 Theoretical Risk for Vulnerability to Particular Infections



  Individuals genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23 are particularly vulnerable to disseminated infections from mycobacteria (including nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria), salmonella (including nontyphi strains), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations. Serious infections and fatal outcomes have been reported in such patients.



 It is not known whether patients with pharmacologic blockade of IL-12/IL-23 from treatment with STELARA  (r)  will be susceptible to these types of infections. Appropriate diagnostic testing should be considered, e.g., tissue culture, stool culture, as dictated by clinical circumstances.



    5.3 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis



  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis infection prior to initiating treatment with STELARA  (r)  .



 Do not administer STELARA  (r)  to patients with active tuberculosis. Initiate treatment of latent tuberculosis prior to administering STELARA  (r)  . Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of STELARA  (r)  in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving STELARA  (r)  should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis during and after treatment.



    5.4 Malignancies



  STELARA  (r)  is an immunosuppressant and may increase the risk of malignancy. Malignancies were reported among subjects who received STELARA  (r)  in clinical studies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . In rodent models, inhibition of IL-12/IL-23p40 increased the risk of malignancy [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13)  ]  .



 The safety of STELARA  (r)  has not been evaluated in patients who have a history of malignancy or who have a known malignancy.



 There have been post marketing reports of the rapid appearance of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients receiving STELARA  (r)  who had pre-existing risk factors for developing non-melanoma skin cancer. All patients receiving STELARA  (r)  should be monitored for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients greater than 60 years of age, those with a medical history of prolonged immunosuppressant therapy and those with a history of PUVA treatment should be followed closely [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions



   Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported post-marketing. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue STELARA  (r)   [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)  ]  .  



    5.6 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome



   One case of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) was observed in the clinical trial safety databases for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The subject, who had received 12 doses of STELARA  (r)  over approximately two years, presented with headache, seizures and confusion. No additional STELARA  (r)  injections were administered and the subject fully recovered with appropriate treatment..  



 RPLS is a neurological disorder, which is not caused by demyelination or a known infectious agent. RPLS can present with headache, seizures, confusion and visual disturbances. Conditions with which it has been associated include preeclampsia, eclampsia, acute hypertension, cytotoxic agents and immunosuppressive therapy. Fatal outcomes have been reported.



  If RPLS is suspected, administer appropriate treatment and discontinue STELARA  (r)  .  



    5.7 Immunizations



  Prior to initiating therapy with STELARA  (r)  , patients should receive all immunizations appropriate for age as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with STELARA  (r)  should not receive live vaccines. BCG vaccines should not be given during treatment with STELARA  (r)  or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving STELARA  (r)  because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient.



 Non-live vaccinations received during a course of STELARA  (r)  may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease.



    5.8 Concomitant Therapies



   In psoriasis studies the safety of STELARA  (r)  in combination with other immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated. In psoriatic arthritis studies, concomitant MTX use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of STELARA  (r)   [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].  Ultraviolet-induced skin cancers developed earlier and more frequently in mice genetically manipulated to be deficient in both IL-12 and IL-23 or IL-12 alone [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13)  ]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In the clinical trials with ELELYSO, either as initial therapy or as therapy following a switch from imiglucerase (N=72), the most common (>= 5%) adverse reactions included pruritus, flushing, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity, abdominal pain, vomiting, fatigue, back pain, dizziness, nausea, and rash.



     Clinical Trials of ELELYSO as Initial Therapy  



     *   Clinical Trial in Patients 19 Years and Older  
    The safety of ELELYSO at dosages of either 30 units/kg (n=16) or 60 units/kg (n=16) every other week was assessed in 32 adult treatment-naive patients (aged 19 to 74 years) with Type 1 Gaucher disease in a 9-month randomized clinical trial.

        Similar adverse reactions were observed in patients who continued ELELYSO treatment during the extension trial for up to 24 months. One patient experienced a mild and intermittent Type III immune-mediated fixed drug eruption and continued in the study.
 

     *   Clinical Trial in Patients 16 Years and Younger  The safety of ELELYSO at dosages of either 30 units/kg (n=4) or 60 units/kg (n=5) every other week was assessed in 9 pediatric treatment-naive patients (aged 2 to 13 years) with Type 1 Gaucher disease in a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
 
    

 The most common adverse reaction (>=10%) was vomiting, which occurred in 4 of 9 patients.

}}     Clinical Trial in Patients Switching from Imiglucerase Treatment to ELELYSO  



 The safety of ELELYSO was assessed in 31 patients (26 adult and 5 pediatric patients), ages 6 to 66 years old, with Type 1 Gaucher disease who had previously been receiving treatment with imiglucerase for a minimum of 2 years. ELELYSO was administered for 9 months at the same number of units as each patient's previous imiglucerase dose.

          6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, patients may develop anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to ELELYSO.



 In clinical trials of treatment-naive adults, 17 (53%) of 32 patients developed ADA during treatment with ELELYSO, and 2 (6%) of 32 patients tested positive for ADA at baseline prior to ELELYSO treatment. Of the 17 patients who developed ADA during ELELYSO treatment, 6 patients (35%) developed hypersensitivity reactions, 2 of whom met criteria for anaphylaxis. Two of the 17 patients who developed ADA during ELELYSO treatment discontinued treatment due to hypersensitivity reactions, one of whom had met criteria for anaphylaxis. Of the 2 patients who tested positive for ADA prior to initiation of ELELYSO treatment, one patient developed a hypersensitivity reaction during the first dose of ELELYSO and withdrew from the study. The second patient did not experience an adverse reaction.



 In a clinical trial of treatment-naive pediatric patients, 2 (22%) of 9 patients developed ADA during treatment with ELELYSO, and one of 9 patients was ADA-positive prior to initiation of ELELYSO. Two patients (1 who developed ADA during treatment and 1 who was ADA-positive at baseline) experienced hypersensitivity reactions. Both patients continued treatment with ELELYSO.



 In a clinical trial of 31 patients (26 adult and 5 pediatric patients) who switched from imiglucerase to ELELYSO treatment, 4 adults (13% of patients) developed ADA during treatment with ELELYSO. Four additional patients (13%, 2 adults and 2 children) tested positive for ADA at baseline but became ADA-negative after the switch to ELELYSO. Two adult patients (1 patient who developed ADA after the switch and 1 who was ADA positive at baseline) experienced hypersensitivity reactions. Both patients continued treatment with ELELYSO.



 The relationship between ADA and hypersensitivity reactions is not fully understood. Monitoring for ADA to ELELYSO may be useful in ADA positive patients or in patients who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions to ELELYSO or other enzyme replacement therapies.



 Twenty-nine of the 30 adult and pediatric patients who tested positive for ADA were tested for neutralizing antibodies capable of inhibiting the enzymatic activity of ELELYSO. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 3 (10.3%) of 29 patients, 2 treatment-naive adult patients and 1 adult patient who switched from imiglucerase. Due to limited available data, it is not possible to determine a relationship between the presence of neutralizing antibodies and therapeutic response with ELELYSO.



 Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ELELYSO with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ELELYSO in countries where it is marketed. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

ELELYSO,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis: Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if anaphylaxis occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Reduction in the infusion rate and/or pre-medication may prevent subsequent reactions (  5.1  ,  6.3  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis



   Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in some patients treated with ELELYSO. In clinical trials, 2 of 72 (2.8%) patients treated with ELELYSO experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of these patients included urticaria, hypotension, flushing, wheezing, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. These reactions occurred during ELELYSO infusion.  



  In clinical trials with ELELYSO, 21 of 72 (29%) patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions included pruritus, angioedema, flushing, erythema, rash, nausea, vomiting, cough, chest tightness, and throat irritation. These reactions have occurred up to 3 hours after the start of infusion [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  



  Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when ELELYSO is administered. Observe patients closely for an appropriate period of time after administration of ELELYSO, taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in clinical trials. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur. If anaphylaxis occurs, ELELYSO should be immediately discontinued, and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated.  



  Management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction and include slowing or temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids for mild reactions. Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent hypersensitivity reactions. Patients were not routinely premedicated prior to infusion of ELELYSO during clinical studies. If severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately stop the infusion of ELELYSO and initiate appropriate treatment.  



  Consider the risks and benefits of re-administering ELELYSO in patients who have experienced a severe reaction associated with ELELYSO. Caution should be exercised upon rechallenge, and appropriate medical support should be readily available [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)  ].

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The STRIVERDI RESPIMAT clinical development program included seven dose-ranging trials and eight confirmatory trials. Four of the confirmatory trials were 6-week cross-over trials and four were 48-week parallel group trials. Adverse reactions observed in the dose-ranging trials and four 6-week cross-over trials were consistent with those observed in the 48-week parallel group trials, which formed the primary safety database.



 The primary safety database consisted of pooled data from the four 48-week double-blind, active and placebo-controlled, parallel group confirmatory clinical trials. These trials included 3104 adult COPD patients (77% males and 23% females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 876 and 883 patients were treated with STRIVERDI RESPIMAT 5 mcg and 10 mcg once-daily, respectively. The STRIVERDI RESPIMAT groups were composed of mostly Caucasians (66%) with a mean age of 64 years and a mean percent predicted FEV1at baseline of 44% for both the 5 mcg and 10 mcg treatment groups. Control arms for comparison included placebo in all four trials plus formoterol 12 mcg in two trials.



 In these four clinical trials, seventy-two percent (72%) of patients exposed to any dose of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT reported an adverse reaction compared to 71% in the placebo group. The proportion of patients who discontinued due to an adverse reaction was 7.2% for STRIVERDI RESPIMAT treated patients compared to 8.8% for placebo treated patients. The adverse reaction most commonly leading to discontinuation was worsening COPD. The most common serious adverse reactions were COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation.



 Table 1 shows all adverse drug reactions reported by at least 2% of patients (and higher than placebo) who received STRIVERDI RESPIMAT 5 mcg during the 48-week trials.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ASTHMA-RELATED DEATH

  WARNING: ASTHMA-RELATED DEATH

    Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) increase the risk of asthma-related death.

Data from a large, placebo-controlled US study that compared the safety

of another long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist

(salmeterol) or placebo added to usual asthma therapy showed an increase

in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol. This finding

with salmeterol is considered a class effect of LABA, including olodaterol,

the active ingredient in STRIVERDI RESPIMAT.  The safety and efficacy

of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in patients with asthma have not been established.

 STRIVERDI RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [  see Contraindications (  4  ), Warnings

and Precautions (  5.1  )  ].  



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: ASTHMA-RELATED DEATH

STRIVERDI,warnings and precautions,"    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Do not initiate STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in acutely deteriorating COPD patients (  5.2  ) 
 *  Do not use for relief of acute symptoms. Concomitant short-acting beta2-agonists can be used as needed for acute relief. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Do not exceed the recommended dose. Excessive use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, or use in conjunction with other medications containing LABA can result in clinically significant cardiovascular effects and may be fatal. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm can occur. Discontinue STRIVERDI RESPIMAT immediately. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis or sensitivity to sympathomimetic drugs (  5.5  ,  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Asthma-Related Death [ see Boxed Warning  ]



    *   Data from a large placebo-controlled study in asthma patients showed that long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists.  
 *   A 28-week, placebo-controlled US study comparing the safety of another long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, including STRIVERDI RESPIMAT. No study adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in patients treated with STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has been conducted. The safety and efficacy of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in patients with asthma have not been established. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [ see Contraindications (  4  ) ].  
       5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes
 

  STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should not be initiated in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD, which may be a life-threatening condition. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in this setting is inappropriate.



 STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist.



 When beginning STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.



 COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If STRIVERDI RESPIMAT no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation of short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation.



    5.3 Excessive Use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT and Use with Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists



  As with other inhaled drugs containing beta2-adrenergic agents, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing long-acting beta2-agonists, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.



    5.4 Paradoxical Bronchospasm



  As with other inhaled beta2-agonists, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.



    5.5 Cardiovascular Effects



  STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Long acting beta2-adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hypertension.



    5.6 Co-existing Conditions



  STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, in patients with known or suspected prolongation of the QT interval, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.



    5.7 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia



  Beta-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [ see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )  ]. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Inhalation of high doses of beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce increases in plasma glucose.



 In patients with severe COPD, hypokalemia may be potentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment [ see Drug Interactions (  7.2  )  ], which may increase the susceptibility for cardiac arrhythmias.



 Clinically notable decreases in serum potassium or changes in blood glucose were infrequent during clinical studies with long-term administration of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT with the rates similar to those for placebo controls. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has not been investigated in patients whose diabetes mellitus is not well controlled.



    5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, may occur after administration of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatment should be considered.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 In 3-month controlled efficacy trials (Study 1 and Study 2), 1263 patients were exposed to BELSOMRA including 493 patients who received BELSOMRA 15 mg or 20 mg (see  Table 1  ).



 In a long-term study, additional patients (n=521) were treated with BELSOMRA at higher than recommended doses, including a total of 160 patients who received BELSOMRA for at least one year.

         The pooled safety data described below (see  Table 2  ) reflect the adverse reaction profile during the first 3 months of treatment.
 

     Adverse Reactions Resulting in Discontinuation of Treatment  



 The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for patients treated with 15 mg or 20 mg of BELSOMRA was 3% compared to 5% for placebo. No individual adverse reaction led to discontinuation at an incidence >=1%.



     Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 In clinical trials of patients with insomnia treated with BELSOMRA 15 mg or 20 mg, the most common adverse reaction (reported in 5% or more of patients treated with BELSOMRA and at least twice the placebo rate) was somnolence (BELSOMRA 7%; placebo 3%).



 Table 2 shows the percentage of patients with adverse reactions during the first three months of treatment, based on the pooled data from 3-month controlled efficacy trials (Study 1 and Study 2).



 At doses of 15 or 20 mg, the incidence of somnolence was higher in females (8%) than in males (3%). Of the adverse reactions reported in Table 2, the following occurred in women at an incidence of at least twice that in men: headache, abnormal dreams, dry mouth, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection.



 The adverse reaction profile in elderly patients was generally consistent with non-elderly patients. The adverse reactions reported during long-term treatment up to 1 year were generally consistent with those observed during the first 3 months of treatment.

             Dose Relationship for Adverse Reactions  
 

 There is evidence of a dose relationship for many of the adverse reactions associated with BELSOMRA use, particularly for certain CNS adverse reactions.



 In a placebo-controlled crossover study (Study 3), non-elderly adult patients were treated for up to one month with BELSOMRA at doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg (2 times the maximum recommended dose) or 80 mg (4 times the maximum recommended dose). In patients treated with BELSOMRA 10 mg (n=62), although no adverse reactions were reported at an incidence of >=2%, the types of adverse reactions observed were similar to those observed in patients treated with BELSOMRA 20 mg. BELSOMRA was associated with a dose-related increase in somnolence: 2% at the 10 mg dose, 5% at the 20 mg dose, 12% at the 40 mg dose, and 11% at the 80 mg dose, compared to <1% for placebo. BELSOMRA was also associated with a dose-related increase in serum cholesterol: 1 mg/dL at the 10 mg dose, 2 mg/dL at the 20 mg dose, 3 mg/dL at the 40 mg dose, and 6 mg/dL at the 80 mg dose after 4 weeks of treatment, compared to a 4 mg/dL decrease for placebo.

   5.1 CNS Depressant Effects and Daytime Impairment



  BELSOMRA is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that can impair daytime wakefulness even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for somnolence and CNS depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of symptoms, and may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e., less than formal testing of daytime wakefulness and/or psychomotor performance). CNS depressant effects may persist in some patients for up to several days after discontinuing BELSOMRA.



 BELSOMRA can impair driving skills and may increase the risk of falling asleep while driving. Discontinue or decrease the dose in patients who drive if daytime somnolence develops. In a study of healthy adults, driving ability was impaired in some individuals taking 20 mg BELSOMRA [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].  Although pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of BELSOMRA may develop with daily use, patients using the 20 mg dose of BELSOMRA should be cautioned against next-day driving and other activities requiring full mental alertness. Patients taking lower doses of BELSOMRA should also be cautioned about the potential for driving impairment because there is individual variation in sensitivity to BELSOMRA.



 Co-administration with other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol) increases the risk of CNS depression. Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with BELSOMRA because of additive effects [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  . Dosage adjustments of BELSOMRA and of concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when administered together because of potentially additive effects. The use of BELSOMRA with other drugs to treat insomnia is not recommended [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



 The risk of next-day impairment, including impaired driving, is increased if BELSOMRA is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining, if a higher than the recommended dose is taken, if co-administered with other CNS depressants, or if co-administered with other drugs that increase blood levels of BELSOMRA. Patients should be cautioned against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness if BELSOMRA is taken in these circumstances.



    5.2 Need to Evaluate for Co-morbid Diagnoses



  Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may be the result of an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or physical disorder, and can emerge during the course of treatment with hypnotic drugs such as BELSOMRA.



    5.3 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes



  A variety of cognitive and behavioral changes (e.g., amnesia, anxiety, hallucinations and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms) have been reported to occur in association with the use of hypnotics such as BELSOMRA. Complex behaviors such as ""sleep-driving"" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after taking a hypnotic) and other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex), with amnesia for the event, have been reported in association with the use of hypnotics. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. The use of alcohol and other CNS depressants may increase the risk of such behaviors. Discontinuation of BELSOMRA should be strongly considered for patients who report any complex sleep behavior.



    5.4 Worsening of Depression/Suicidal Ideation



  In clinical studies, a dose-dependent increase in suicidal ideation was observed in patients taking BELSOMRA as assessed by questionnaire. Immediately evaluate patients with suicidal ideation or any new behavioral sign or symptom.



 In primarily depressed patients treated with sedative-hypnotics, worsening of depression, and suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides) have been reported. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdose is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the lowest number of tablets that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time.



 The emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.



    5.5 Patients with Compromised Respiratory Function



  Effect of BELSOMRA on respiratory function should be considered if prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function. BELSOMRA has not been studied in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].  



    5.6 Sleep Paralysis, Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations, Cataplexy-like Symptoms



  Sleep paralysis, an inability to move or speak for up to several minutes during sleep-wake transitions, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, including vivid and disturbing perceptions by the patient, can occur with the use of BELSOMRA. Prescribers should explain the nature of these events to patients when prescribing BELSOMRA.



 Symptoms similar to mild cataplexy can occur, with risk increasing with the dose of BELSOMRA. Such symptoms can include periods of leg weakness lasting from seconds to a few minutes, can occur both at night and during the day, and may not be associated with an identified triggering event (e.g., laughter or surprise).

NPLATE,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (>= 5% higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo) are arthralgia, dizziness, insomnia, myalgia, pain in extremity, abdominal pain, shoulder pain, dyspepsia, and paresthesia. Headache was the most commonly reported adverse reaction that did not occur at >= 5% higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo. (  6.1  )



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Inc. at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) or  FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch  .      



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Serious adverse reactions associated with Nplate in ITP clinical studies were bone marrow reticulin deposition and worsening thrombocytopenia after Nplate discontinuation [  see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ,  5.4  )  ].



 The data described below reflect Nplate exposure to 271 patients with chronic ITP, aged 18 to 88, of whom 62% were female.  Nplate was studied in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies that were identical in design, with the exception that Study 1 evaluated nonsplenectomized patients with ITP and Study 2 evaluated splenectomized patients with ITP.  Data are also reported from an open-label, single-arm study in which patients received Nplate over an extended period of time.  Overall, Nplate was administered to 114 patients for at least 52 weeks and 53 patients for at least 96 weeks.



 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In the placebo-controlled studies, headache was the most commonly reported adverse drug reaction, occurring in 35% of patients receiving Nplate and 32% of patients receiving placebo. Headaches were usually of mild or moderate severity.  Table 2 presents adverse drug reactions from Studies 1 and 2 with a >= 5% higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo. The majority of these adverse drug reactions were mild to moderate in severity.

  Preferred Term    Nplate  (n = 84)     Placebo  (n = 41)    
  Arthralgia       26%              20%              
  Dizziness        17%              0%               
  Insomnia         16%              7%               
  Myalgia          14%              2%               
  Pain in Extremity   13%              5%               
  Abdominal Pain   11%              0%               
  Shoulder Pain    8%               0%               
  Dyspepsia        7%               0%               
  Paresthesia      6%               0%               
         Among 142 patients with chronic ITP who received Nplate in the single-arm extension study, the incidence rates of the adverse reactions occurred in a pattern similar to those reported in the placebo-controlled clinical studies.
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Nplate.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Erythromelalgia 
 *  Hypersensitivity 
 *  Angioedema 
      6.3 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, patients may develop antibodies to the therapeutic protein.  Patients were screened for immunogenicity to romiplostim using a BIAcore-based biosensor immunoassay.  This assay is capable of detecting both high- and low-affinity binding antibodies that bind to romiplostim and cross-react with TPO.  The samples from patients that tested positive for binding antibodies were further evaluated for neutralizing capacity using a cell-based bioassay.



 In clinical studies, the incidence of preexisting antibodies to romiplostim was 8% (43/537) and the incidence of binding antibody development during Nplate treatment was 6% (31/537).  The incidence of preexisting antibodies to endogenous TPO was 5% (29/537) and the incidence of binding antibody development to endogenous TPO during Nplate treatment was 4% (21/537).  Of the patients with positive binding antibodies that developed to romiplostim or to TPO, two (0.4%) patients had neutralizing activity to romiplostim and none had neutralizing activity to TPO.  No correlation was observed between antibody activity and clinical effectiveness or safety.



 Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay used in detection and may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to romiplostim with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

NPLATE,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  In patients with MDS, Nplate increases blast cell counts and increases the risk of progression to acute myelogenous leukemia. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with Nplate use. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving Nplate. Use with additional caution in ITP patients with chronic liver disease. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Discontinuation of Nplate may result in worsened thrombocytopenia than was present prior to Nplate therapy. Monitor complete blood counts (CBCs), including platelet counts, for at least 2 weeks following Nplate discontinuation. (  5.4  ) 
 *  If severe thrombocytopenia develops during Nplate treatment, assess patients for the formation of neutralizing antibodies. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Progression of Myelodysplastic Syndromes to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia



  Progression from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has been observed in clinical trials with Nplate.  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling patients with severe thrombocytopenia and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low or intermediate-1 risk MDS was terminated due to more cases of AML observed in the Nplate treatment arm.  At the time of an interim analysis, among 219 MDS patients randomized 2:1 to treatment with Nplate or placebo (147 Nplate: 72 placebo), 11 patients showed progression to AML, including nine on the Nplate arm versus two on the placebo arm.  In addition, in peripheral blood counts, the percentage of circulating myeloblasts increased to greater than 10% in 28 patients, 25 of whom were in the romiplostim treatment arm.  Of the 28 patients who had an increase in circulating myeloblasts to greater than 10%, eight of these patients were diagnosed to have AML and 20 patients had not progressed to AML. In four patients, increased peripheral blood blast cell counts decreased to baseline after discontinuation of Nplate.  In a single-arm trial of Nplate given to 72 patients with thrombocytopenia related to MDS, eight (11%) patients were reported as having possible disease progression, and three patients had confirmation of AML during follow-up.  In addition, in three patients, increased peripheral blood blast cell counts decreased to baseline after discontinuation of Nplate.



 Nplate is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any cause of thrombocytopenia other than chronic ITP.



    5.2 Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications



  Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with Nplate use.  Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving Nplate.  Nplate should be used with caution in patients with ITP and chronic liver disease.



 To minimize the risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, do not use Nplate in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. Follow the dose adjustment guidelines to achieve and maintain a platelet count of >= 50 x 10  9  /L [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )  ].



    5.3 Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation and Risk for Bone Marrow Fibrosis



  Nplate administration may increase the risk for development or progression of reticulin fiber formation within the bone marrow. This formation may improve upon discontinuation of Nplate.  In a clinical trial, one patient with ITP and hemolytic anemia developed marrow fibrosis with collagen during Nplate therapy.  Clinical trials are in progress to assess the risk of bone marrow fibrosis and clinical consequences with cytopenias.



 If new or worsening morphological abnormalities or cytopenia(s) occur, consider a bone marrow biopsy to include staining for fibrosis [ see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )  ].



    5.4 Worsened Thrombocytopenia after Cessation of Nplate



  In clinical studies of patients with chronic ITP who had Nplate discontinued, four of 57 patients developed thrombocytopenia of greater severity than was present prior to Nplate therapy.  This worsened thrombocytopenia resolved within 14 days.  Following discontinuation of Nplate, obtain weekly CBCs, including platelet counts, for at least 2 weeks and consider alternative treatments for worsening thrombocytopenia, according to current treatment guidelines [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



    5.5 Lack or Loss of Response to Nplate



  Hyporesponsiveness or failure to maintain a platelet response with Nplate should prompt a search for causative factors, including neutralizing antibodies to Nplate [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.3  )  ].  To detect antibody formation, submit blood samples to Amgen (1-800-772-6436).  Amgen will assay these samples for antibodies to Nplate and thrombopoietin (TPO).  Discontinue Nplate if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4 weeks at the highest weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg.



    5.6 Laboratory Monitoring



  Obtain CBCs, including platelet counts, weekly during the dose-adjustment phase of Nplate therapy and then monthly following establishment of a stable Nplate dose.  Obtain CBCs, including platelet counts, weekly for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of Nplate [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ,  5.4  )  ].

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of ORBACTIV cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 ORBACTIV has been evaluated in two, double-blind, controlled ABSSSI clinical trials, which included 976 adult patients treated with a single 1200 mg intravenous dose of ORBACTIV and 983 patients treated with intravenous vancomycin for 7 to 10 days. The median age of patients treated with ORBACTIV was 45.6 years, ranging between 18 and 89 years of age with 8.8% >=65 years of age. Patients treated with ORBACTIV were predominantly male (65.4%), 64.4% were Caucasian, 5.8% were African American, and 28.1% were Asian. Safety was evaluated for up to 60 days after dosing.



 In the pooled ABSSSI clinical trials, serious adverse reactions were reported in 57/976 (5.8%) patients treated with ORBACTIV and 58/983 (5.9%) treated with vancomycin. The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was cellulitis in both treatment groups: 11/976 (1.1%) in ORBACTIV and 12/983 (1.2%) in the vancomycin arms, respectively.



 The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>=3%) in patients receiving a single 1200 mg dose of ORBACTIV in the pooled ABSSSI clinical trials were: headache, nausea, vomiting, limb and subcutaneous abscesses, and diarrhea.



 In the pooled ABSSSI clinical trials, ORBACTIV was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 36/976 (3.7%) of patients; the most common reported reactions leading to discontinuation were cellulitis (4/976, 0.4%) and osteomyelitis (3/976, 0.3%).



   Table 1  provides selected adverse reactions occurring in >= 1.5% of patients receiving ORBACTIV in the pooled ABSSSI clinical trials. There were 540 (55.3%) patients in the ORBACTIV arm and 559 (56.9%) patients in the vancomycin arm, who reported >=1 adverse reaction.

   5.1 Potential Risk of Bleeding with Concomitant Use of Warfarin



  Co-administration of ORBACTIV and warfarin may result in higher exposure of warfarin, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Use ORBACTIV in patients on chronic warfarin therapy only when the benefits can be expected to outweigh the risk of bleeding. Frequently monitor for signs of bleeding. [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



 ORBACTIV has been shown to artificially prolong PT and INR for up to 24 hours, making the monitoring of the anticoagulation effect of warfarin unreliable up to 24 hours after an ORBACTIV dose. [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  



    5.2 Coagulation Test Interference



  ORBACTIV has been shown to artificially prolong aPTT for 48 hours and the PT and INR for 24 hours by binding to and preventing action of the phospholipid reagents which activate coagulation in commonly used laboratory coagulation tests.



 For patients who require aPTT monitoring within 48 hours of ORBACTIV dosing, a non-phospholipid dependent coagulation test such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT monitoring may be considered.



 Effects by ORBACTIV on activated clotting time (ACT) are expected since the phospholipid reagents are also utilized in this coagulation test. ORBACTIV has no effect on the coagulation system. [see Contraindications (  4.1  ) and Drug Interactions (  7.2  )]  



    5.3 Hypersensitivity



  Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of ORBACTIV. If an acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs during ORBACTIV infusion, discontinue ORBACTIV immediately and institute appropriate supportive care. Before using ORBACTIV, inquire carefully about previous hypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides. Due to the possibility of cross-sensitivity, carefully monitor for signs of hypersensitivity during ORBACTIV infusion in patients with a history of glycopeptide allergy. In the Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, the median onset of hypersensitivity reactions in ORBACTIV-treated patients was 1.2 days and the median duration of these reactions was 2.4 days. [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  



    5.4 Infusion Related Reactions



  Infusion related reactions have been reported with ORBACTIV including pruritus, urticaria or flushing. If reactions do occur, consider slowing or interrupting ORBACTIV infusion. [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  



    5.5 Clostridium difficile  -associated Diarrhea



   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including ORBACTIV, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



    5.6 Osteomyelitis



  In Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, more cases of osteomyelitis were reported in the ORBACTIV treated arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis. If osteomyelitis is suspected or diagnosed, institute appropriate alternate antibacterial therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.7 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria



  Prescribing ORBACTIV in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described in the Warnings and Precautions section and below reflect exposure to MEKINIST as a single agent and in combination with dabrafenib. MEKINIST as a single agent was evaluated in 329 patients including 107 (33%) exposed for greater than or equal to 6 months and 30 (9%) exposed for greater than or equal to one year. MEKINIST as a single agent was studied in open-label, single-arm trials (N = 118) or in an open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial (N = 211). The median age was 54 years, 60% were male, >99% were white, and all patients had metastatic melanoma. All patients received 2 mg once-daily doses of MEKINIST. The incidence of RPED and RVO are obtained from the 1,749 patients from all clinical trials with MEKINIST.



 The safety of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib was evaluated in Trial 2 and other trials consisting of 202 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among these 202 patients, 68 (34%) were exposed to MEKINIST and 66 (33%) were exposed to dabrafenib for greater than 6 to 12 months while 36 (18%) were exposed to MEKINIST and 40 (20%) were exposed to dabrafenib for greater than one year. The median age was 54 years, 57% were male and >99% were white.



 Table 3 presents adverse reactions identified from analyses of Trial 1, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma receiving MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1,000 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks)  [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]  . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded from Trial 1. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In Trial 1, 9% of patients receiving MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most common reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

    Table 5 presents adverse reactions from Trial 2, a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of 162 patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma receiving MEKINIST 2 mg once daily in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily (N = 55), MEKINIST 1 mg once daily in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily (N = 54), and dabrafenib as a single agent 150 mg twice daily (N = 53)  [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]  . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of RVO, or RPED, QTc interval >=480 msec, treatment refractory hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, or a known history of G6PD deficiency were excluded. The median duration of treatment was 10.9 months for both MEKINIST (2-mg once-daily treatment group) and dabrafenib when used in combination, 10.6 months for both MEKINIST (1-mg once-daily treatment group) and dabrafenib when used in combination, and 6.1 months for dabrafenib as a single agent.
 

 In Trial 2, 13% of patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib at the recommended dose experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication(s). The most common adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation was pyrexia (4%). Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 49% and dose interruptions in 67% of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib. Pyrexia, chills, and nausea were the most common reasons cited for dose reductions, and pyrexia, chills, and decreased ejection fraction were the most common reasons cited for dose interruptions of MEKINIST and dabrafenib when used in combination.

      EXCERPT:   
 

    5.1 New Primary Malignancies  



   New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib and with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  



   Cutaneous Malignancies:    



  In Trial 2, the incidence of basal cell carcinoma was increased in patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib, with an incidence of 9% (5/55) in patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with 2% (1/53) in patients receiving dabrafenib as a single agent. The range of time to diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma was 28 to 249 days in patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and was 197 days for the patient receiving dabrafenib as a single agent.  



  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), including keratoacanthoma, occurred in 7% of patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and 19% of patients receiving dabrafenib as a single agent. The range of time to diagnosis of cuSCC was 136 to 197 days in the combination arm and was 9 to 197 days in the arm receiving dabrafenib as a single agent.  



  New primary melanoma occurred in 2% (1/53) of patients receiving dabrafenib and in none of the 55 patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib.  



  Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib, every 2 months while on therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of the combination. No dose modifications of MEKINIST or dabrafenib are recommended in patients who develop new primary cutaneous malignancies.  



   Non-Cutaneous Malignancies:    



  Based on its mechanism of action, dabrafenib may promote growth and development of malignancies with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [refer to the Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  . In patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib, four cases of non-cutaneous malignancies were identified: KRAS mutation-positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 1), recurrent NRAS mutation-positive colorectal carcinoma (n = 1), head and neck carcinoma (n = 1), and glioblastoma (n = 1). Monitor patients receiving the combination closely for signs or symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. If used in combination with dabrafenib, no dose modification is required for MEKINIST in patients who develop non-cutaneous malignancies. Permanently discontinue dabrafenib in patients who develop RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies.  



     5.2 Hemorrhage  



   Hemorrhages, including major hemorrhages defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib.  



  In Trial 2, treatment with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib resulted in an increased incidence and severity of any hemorrhagic event: 16% (9/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with 2% (1/53) of patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. The major hemorrhagic events of intracranial or gastric hemorrhage occurred in 5% (3/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with none of the 53 patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. Intracranial hemorrhage was fatal in two (4%) patients receiving the combination of MEKINIST and dabrafenib.  



  Permanently discontinue MEKINIST, and also permanently discontinue dabrafenib if administered in combination, for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold MEKINIST for up to 3 weeks for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved resume at a lower dose level. Withhold dabrafenib for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved resume at a lower dose level.  



     5.3 Venous Thromboembolism  



   Venous thromboembolism can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib.  



  In Trial 2, treatment with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib resulted in an increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): 7% (4/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with none of the 53 patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. Pulmonary embolism was fatal in one (2%) patient receiving the combination of MEKINIST and dabrafenib.  



  Advise patients to immediately seek medical care if they develop symptoms of DVT or PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST and dabrafenib for life threatening PE. Withhold MEKINIST for uncomplicated DVT and PE for up to 3 weeks; if improved, MEKINIST may be resumed at a lower dose level. Do not modify the dose of dabrafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  



     5.4 Cardiomyopathy  



   Cardiomyopathy can occur when MEKINIST is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with dabrafenib.  



  In Trial 1, cardiomyopathy (defined as cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or decreased left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) occurred in 7% (14/211) of patients treated with MEKINIST; no chemotherapy-treated patients in Trial 1 developed cardiomyopathy. In Trial 2, cardiomyopathy occurred in 9% (5/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and in none of patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. The median time to onset of cardiomyopathy in patients treated with MEKINIST was 63 days (range: 16 to 156 days) for Trial 1 and 86 days (range: 27 to 253 days) for Trial 2.  



  Cardiomyopathy was identified within the first month of treatment with MEKINIST in 5 of 14 patients in Trial 1 and in 2 of 5 patients in Trial 2. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in dose reduction (7/211) and/or discontinuation (4/211) of study drug in Trial 1, and resulted in dose reduction (4/55) and/or dose interruption (1/55) in Trial 2. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 10 of 14 (71%) patients in Trial 1 and in all 5 patients in Trial 2.  



  Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered either as a single agent (N = 329), or in combination with dabrafenib (N = 202), 11% and 8% of patients, respectively, developed evidence of cardiomyopathy (decrease in LVEF below institutional lower limits of normal with an absolute decrease in LVEF >=10% below baseline). Five percent and 2% in single-agent and in combination trials, respectively, demonstrated a decrease in LVEF below institutional lower limits of normal with an absolute decrease in LVEF of >=20% below baseline.  



  Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of MEKINIST as a single agent and in combination with dabrafenib, one month after initiation, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. Withhold treatment with MEKINIST for up to 4 weeks if absolute LVEF value decreases by 10% from pretreatment values and is less than the lower limit of normal. For symptomatic cardiomyopathy or persistent, asymptomatic LV dysfunction that does not resolve within 4 weeks, permanently discontinue MEKINIST and withhold dabrafenib. Resume dabrafenib at the same dose upon recovery of cardiac function [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .

  Across all clinical trials of MEKINIST, the incidence of RVO was 0.2% (4/1,749). RVO may lead to macular edema, decreased visual function, neovascularization, and glaucoma.  



  Urgently (within 24 hours) perform ophthalmological evaluation for patient-reported loss of vision or other visual disturbances. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST in patients with documented RVO. If MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib, do not modify dabrafenib dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  



   Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED):    



  Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) can occur when MEKINIST is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with dabrafenib  .



  In Trial 1 and Trial 2, ophthalmologic examinations including retinal evaluation were performed pretreatment and at regular intervals during treatment.  



  In Trial 1, one patient (0.5%) receiving MEKINIST developed RPED and no cases of RPED were identified in chemotherapy-treated patients. Across all clinical trials of MEKINIST, the incidence of RPED was 0.8% (14/1,749). Retinal detachments were often bilateral and multifocal, occurring in the macular region of the retina. RPED led to reduction in visual acuity that resolved after a median of 11.5 days (range: 3 to 71 days) following the interruption of dosing with MEKINIST, although Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) abnormalities persisted beyond a month in at least several cases.  



  In Trial 2, one patient (2%) receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib developed RPED.  



  Perform ophthalmological evaluation at any time a patient reports visual disturbances and compare with baseline, if available. Withhold MEKINIST if RPED is diagnosed. If resolution of the RPED is documented on repeat ophthalmological evaluation within 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at a lower dose level. Discontinue MEKINIST if no improvement after 3 weeks. If MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib, do not modify the dose of dabrafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  



   Uveitis and Iritis:    



  Uveitis and iritis can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib and with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  



  Uveitis occurred in 1% (2/202) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib.  



  Symptomatic treatment employed in clinical trials included steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops. Monitor patients for visual signs and symptoms of uveitis (e.g., change in vision, photophobia, eye pain). If diagnosed, withhold dabrafenib for up to 6 weeks until uveitis/iritis resolves to Grade 0-1. If not improved, permanently discontinue dabrafenib. If MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib, do not modify the dose of MEKINIST [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  



    5.6 Interstitial Lung Disease



  In clinical trials of MEKINIST (N = 329) as a single agent, ILD or pneumonitis occurred in 2% of patients. In Trial 1, 2% (5/211) of patients treated with MEKINIST developed ILD or pneumonitis; all five patients required hospitalization. The median time to first presentation of ILD or pneumonitis was 160 days (range: 60 to 172 days).



 Withhold MEKINIST in patients presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings including cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis. If MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib, do not modify the dose of dabrafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].    



     5.7 Serious Febrile Reactions  



   Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib and with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  



  The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib compared with dabrafenib as a single agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .  



  In Trial 2, the incidence of fever (serious and non-serious) was 71% (39/55) in patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and 26% (14/53) in patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors, or chills occurred in 25% (14/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with 2% (1/53) of patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. Fever was complicated with chills/rigors in 51% (28/55), dehydration in 9% (5/55), renal failure in 4% (2/55), and syncope in 4% (2/55) of patients in Trial 2. In patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib, the median time to initial onset of fever was 30 days compared with 19 days in patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent; the median duration of fever was 6 days with the combination compared with 4 days with dabrafenib as a single agent.  



  Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered in combination with dabrafenib (N = 202), the incidence of pyrexia was 57% (116/202).  



  Withhold dabrafenib for fever of 101.3oF or higher. Withhold MEKINIST for fever higher than 104oF. Withhold dabrafenib and MEKINIST for any serious febrile reaction or fever accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, and evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection. Refer to Table 2 for recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  . Prophylaxis with antipyretics may be required when resuming MEKINIST or dabrafenib.  



    5.8 Serious Skin Toxicity



   Serious skin toxicity can occur when MEKINIST is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with dabrafenib. Serious skin toxicity can also occur with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  



 In Trial 1, the overall incidence of any skin toxicity, the most common of which were rash, dermatitis acneiform rash, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and erythema, was 87% in patients treated with MEKINIST and 13% in chemotherapy-treated patients. Severe skin toxicity occurred in 12% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Skin toxicity requiring hospitalization occurred in 6% of patients treated with MEKINIST, most commonly for secondary infections of the skin requiring intravenous antibiotics or severe skin toxicity without secondary infection. In comparison, no patients treated with chemotherapy required hospitalization for severe skin toxicity or infections of the skin. The median time to onset of skin toxicity in patients treated with MEKINIST was 15 days (range: 1 to 221 days) and median time to resolution of skin toxicity was 48 days (range: 1 to 282 days). Reductions in the dose of MEKINIST were required in 12% and permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST was required in 1% of patients with skin toxicity.



  In Trial 2, the incidence of any skin toxicity was similar for patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib (65% [36/55]) compared with patients receiving dabrafenib as a single agent (68% [36/53]). The median time to onset of skin toxicity in patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib was 37 days (range: 1 to 225 days) and median time to resolution of skin toxicity was 33 days (range: 3 to 421 days). No patient required dose reduction or permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST or dabrafenib for skin toxicity.  



  Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered in combination with dabrafenib (n = 202), severe skin toxicity and secondary infection of the skin requiring hospitalization occurred in 2.5% (5/202) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib.  



  Withhold MEKINIST, and dabrafenib if used in combination, for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. MEKINIST and dabrafenib may be resumed at lower dose levels in patients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  



     5.9 Hyperglycemia  



   Hyperglycemia can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib and with dabrafenib as a single agent. Hyperglycemia requiring an increase in the dose of, or initiation of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent therapy occurred with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  



  In Trial 2, the incidence of Grade 3 hyperglycemia based on laboratory values was 5% (3/55) in patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with 2% (1/53) in patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent.  



  Monitor serum glucose levels as clinically appropriate during treatment with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib in patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperglycemia. Advise patients to report symptoms of severe hyperglycemia.  



    5.10 Embryofetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. MEKINIST was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].  



 Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after treatment. Advise patients to use a highly effective non-hormonal method of contraception when MEKINIST is administered in combination with dabrafenib, since dabrafenib can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective.  Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking MEKINIST [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.6)].

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Gastric Cancer  



 Safety data are presented from two randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials in which patients received CYRAMZA: Study 1, a randomized (2:1), double-blind, clinical trial in which 351 patients received either CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks or placebo every two weeks and Study 2, a double-blind, randomized (1:1) clinical trial in which 656 patients received paclitaxel 80 mg/m  2  on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle plus either CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks or placebo every two weeks. Both trials excluded patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2 or greater, uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days, or patients receiving chronic anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin. Study 1 excluded patients with bilirubin >=1.5 mg/dL and Study 2 excluded patients with bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of normal.



     CYRAMZA Administered as a Single Agent  



 Among 236 patients who received CYRAMZA (safety population) in Study 1, median age was 60 years, 28% were women, 76% were White, and 16% were Asian. Patients in Study 1 received a median of 4 doses of CYRAMZA; the median duration of exposure was 8 weeks, and 32 (14% of 236) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six months.



 In Study 1, the most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA-treated patients at a rate of >=10% and >=2% higher than placebo were hypertension and diarrhea. The most common serious adverse events with CYRAMZA were anemia (3.8%) and intestinal obstruction (2.1%). Red blood cell transfusions were given to 11% of CYRAMZA-treated patients versus 8.7% of patients who received placebo.

           Clinically relevant adverse reactions reported in >=1% and <5% of CYRAMZA-treated patients in Study 1 were: neutropenia (4.7% CYRAMZA versus 0.9% placebo), epistaxis (4.7% CYRAMZA versus 0.9% placebo), rash (4.2% CYRAMZA versus 1.7% placebo), intestinal obstruction (2.1% CYRAMZA versus 0% placebo), and arterial thromboembolic events (1.7% CYRAMZA versus 0% placebo)  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ,  5.2  )]  .
 

 Across clinical trials of CYRAMZA administered as a single agent, clinically relevant adverse reactions (including Grade >=3) reported in CYRAMZA-treated patients included proteinuria, gastrointestinal perforation, and infusion-related reactions.



 In Study 1, according to laboratory assessment, 8% of CYRAMZA-treated patients developed proteinuria versus 3% of placebo-treated patients. Two patients discontinued CYRAMZA due to proteinuria. The rate of gastrointestinal perforation in Study 1 was 0.8% and the rate of infusion-related reactions was 0.4%  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ,  2.3  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ,  5.5  )]  .



     CYRAMZA Administered in Combination with Paclitaxel  



 Among 327 patients who received CYRAMZA (safety population) in Study 2, median age was 61 years, 31% were women, 63% were White, and 33% were Asian. Patients in Study 2 received a median of 9 doses of CYRAMZA; the median duration of exposure was 18 weeks, and 93 (28% of 327) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six months.



 In Study 2, the most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in patients treated with CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel at a rate of >=30% and >=2% higher than placebo plus paclitaxel were fatigue, neutropenia, diarrhea, and epistaxis. The most common serious adverse events with CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel were neutropenia (3.7%) and febrile neutropenia (2.4%); 19% of patients treated with CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel received granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of any component of the CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel combination in 2% or more patients in Study 2 were neutropenia (4%) and thrombocytopenia (3%).

     Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  



     CYRAMZA Administered in Combination with Docetaxel  



 Study 3 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind study conducted in patients with NSCLC with disease progression on or after one platinum-based therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients received either CYRAMZA 10 mg/kg intravenously plus docetaxel 75 mg/m  2  intravenously every 3 weeks or placebo plus docetaxel 75 mg/m  2  intravenously every 3 weeks. Due to an increased incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in patients enrolled in East Asian sites, Study 3 was amended and 24 patients (11 CYRAMZA plus docetaxel, 13 placebo plus docetaxel) at East Asian sites received a starting dose of docetaxel at 60 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks.



 Study 3 excluded patients with an ECOG PS of 2 or greater, bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN), uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days, radiographic evidence of major airway or blood vessel invasion by cancer, radiographic evidence of intra-tumor cavitation, or gross hemoptysis within the preceding 2 months, and patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or chronic anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin. The study also excluded patients whose only prior treatment for advanced NSCLC was a tyrosine kinase (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] or anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]) inhibitor.



 The data described below reflect exposure to CYRAMZA plus docetaxel in 627 patients in Study 3. Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms. Median age was 62 years; 67% of patients were men; 84% were White and 12% were Asian; 33% had ECOG PS 0; 74% had non-squamous histology and 25% had squamous histology. Patients received a median of 4.5 doses of CYRAMZA; the median duration of exposure was 3.5 months, and 195 (31% of 627) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six months.



 In Study 3, the most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA plus docetaxel-treated patients at a rate of >=30% and >=2% higher than placebo plus docetaxel were neutropenia, fatigue/asthenia, and stomatitis/mucosal inflammation. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred more frequently in CYRAMZA plus docetaxel-treated patients (9%) than in placebo plus docetaxel-treated patients (5%). The most common adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation of CYRAMZA were infusion-related reaction (0.5%) and epistaxis (0.3%). For patients with non-squamous histology, the overall incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was 7% and the incidence of >=Grade 3 pulmonary hemorrhage was 1% for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel compared to 6% overall incidence and 1% for >=Grade 3 pulmonary hemorrhage for placebo plus docetaxel. For patients with squamous histology, the overall incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was 10% and the incidence of >=Grade 3 pulmonary hemorrhage was 2% for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel compared to 12% overall incidence and 2% for >=Grade 3 pulmonary hemorrhage for placebo plus docetaxel.



 The most common serious adverse events with CYRAMZA plus docetaxel were febrile neutropenia (14%), pneumonia (6%), and neutropenia (5%). The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors was 42% in CYRAMZA plus docetaxel-treated patients versus 37% in patients who received placebo plus docetaxel. In patients >=65 years, there were 18 (8%) deaths on treatment or within 30 days of discontinuation for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel and 9 (4%) deaths for placebo plus docetaxel. In patients <65 years, there were 13 (3%) deaths on treatment or within 30 days of discontinuation for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel and 26 (6%) deaths for placebo plus docetaxel.

     Colorectal Cancer  



     CYRAMZA Administered in Combination with FOLFIRI  



 Study 4 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind study conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with disease progression on or after therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine. Patients received either CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg intravenously plus FOLFIRI intravenously every 2 weeks or placebo plus FOLFIRI intravenously every 2 weeks.



 Study 4 excluded patients with an ECOG PS of 2 or greater, uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days, and those who experienced any of the following during first-line therapy with a bevacizumab-containing regimen: an arterial thrombotic/thromboembolic event; Grade 4 hypertension; Grade 3 proteinuria; a Grade 3-4 bleeding event; or bowel perforation.



 Demographics and baseline characteristics for the treated population were similar between treatment arms (n=1057). Median age was 62 years; 57% of patients were men; 76% were White and 20% were Asian; 48% had ECOG PS 0.



 The data described in this section reflect exposure to CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI in 529 patients in Study 4. Patients received a median of 8 doses (range 1-68) of CYRAMZA; the median duration of exposure was 4.4 months, and 169 (32% of 529) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six months. The most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI-treated patients at a rate of >=30% and >=2% higher than placebo plus FOLFIRI were diarrhea, neutropenia, decreased appetite, epistaxis, and stomatitis. Twenty percent of patients treated with CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI received granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Treatment discontinuation of any study drug due to adverse reactions occurred more frequently in CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI-treated patients (29%) than in placebo plus FOLFIRI-treated patients (13%).



 The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of any component of CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI as compared to placebo plus FOLFIRI, were neutropenia (12.5% versus 5.3%) and thrombocytopenia (4.2% versus 0.8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation of CYRAMZA were proteinuria (1.5%) and gastrointestinal perforation (1.7%).



 The most common serious adverse events with CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI were diarrhea (3.6%), intestinal obstruction (3.0%), and febrile neutropenia (2.8%).

 Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were evaluated in 224 patients (115 CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI-treated patients and 109 placebo plus FOLFIRI-treated patients) with normal baseline TSH levels. Patients underwent periodic TSH laboratory assessments until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. Increased TSH levels were observed in 53 (46%) patients treated with CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI compared with 4 (4%) patients treated with placebo plus FOLFIRI.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. In 23 clinical trials, 86/2890 (3.0%) of CYRAMZA-treated patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 14 of the 86 patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to CYRAMZA with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

      5.1 Hemorrhage



     CYRAMZA increased the risk of hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhagic events. In Study 1, the incidence of severe bleeding was 3.4% for CYRAMZA and 2.6% for placebo. In Study 2, the incidence of severe bleeding was 4.3% for CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel and 2.4% for placebo plus paclitaxel.



    Patients with gastric cancer receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were excluded from enrollment in Studies 1 and 2; therefore, the risk of gastric hemorrhage in CYRAMZA-treated patients with gastric tumors receiving NSAIDs is unknown.



    In Study 3, the incidence of severe bleeding was 2.4% for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel and 2.3% for placebo plus docetaxel. Patients with NSCLC receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or chronic therapy with NSAIDS or other anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin or with radiographic evidence of major airway or blood vessel invasion or intratumor cavitation were excluded from Study 3; therefore the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage in these groups of patients is unknown.



    In Study 4, the incidence of severe bleeding was 2.5% for CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI and 1.7% for placebo plus FOLFIRI.



    Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience severe bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



    5.2 Arterial Thromboembolic Events



  Serious, sometimes fatal, arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular accident, and cerebral ischemia occurred in clinical trials including 1.7% of 236 patients who received CYRAMZA as a single agent for gastric cancer in Study 1. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a severe ATE [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



       5.3 Hypertension



     An increased incidence of severe hypertension occurred in patients receiving CYRAMZA as a single agent (8%) as compared to placebo (3%), in patients receiving CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel (15%) as compared to placebo plus paclitaxel (3%), in patients receiving CYRAMZA plus docetaxel (6%) as compared to placebo plus docetaxel (2%), and in patients receiving CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI (11%) as compared to placebo plus FOLFIRI (3%).



 Control hypertension prior to initiating treatment with CYRAMZA. Monitor blood pressure every two weeks or more frequently as indicated during treatment.



 Temporarily suspend CYRAMZA for severe hypertension until medically controlled. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA if medically significant hypertension cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy or in patients with hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



    5.4 Infusion-Related Reactions



  Prior to the institution of premedication recommendations across clinical trials of CYRAMZA, IRRs occurred in 6 out of 37 patients (16%), including two severe events. The majority of IRRs across trials occurred during or following a first or second CYRAMZA infusion. Symptoms of IRRs included rigors/tremors, back pain/spasms, chest pain and/or tightness, chills, flushing, dyspnea, wheezing, hypoxia, and paresthesia. In severe cases, symptoms included bronchospasm, supraventricular tachycardia, and hypotension.



 Monitor patients during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRRs in a setting with available resuscitation equipment. Immediately and permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for Grade 3 or 4 IRRs [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



       5.5 Gastrointestinal Perforations



     CYRAMZA is an antiangiogenic therapy that can increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, a potentially fatal event. Four of 570 patients (0.7%) who received CYRAMZA as a single agent in clinical trials experienced gastrointestinal perforation. In Study 2, the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was also increased in patients that received CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel (1.2%) as compared to patients receiving placebo plus paclitaxel (0.3%). In Study 3, the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was 1% for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel and 0.3% for placebo plus docetaxel. In Study 4, the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was 1.7% for CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI and 0.6% for placebo plus FOLFIRI. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a gastrointestinal perforation [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



       5.6 Impaired Wound Healing



     Impaired wound healing can occur with antibodies inhibiting the VEGF pathway. CYRAMZA has not been studied in patients with serious or non-healing wounds. CYRAMZA, an antiangiogenic therapy, has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Discontinue CYRAMZA therapy in patients with impaired wound healing.



    Withhold CYRAMZA prior to surgery. Resume following the surgical intervention based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. If a patient develops wound healing complications during therapy, discontinue CYRAMZA until the wound is fully healed [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



    5.7 Clinical Deterioration in Patients with Child-Pugh B or C Cirrhosis



  Clinical deterioration, manifested by new onset or worsening encephalopathy, ascites, or hepatorenal syndrome was reported in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis who received single-agent CYRAMZA. Use CYRAMZA in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis only if the potential benefits of treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of clinical deterioration.



    5.8 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome



  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been reported with a rate of <0.1% in clinical studies with CYRAMZA. Confirm the diagnosis of RPLS with MRI and discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who develop RPLS. Symptoms may resolve or improve within days, although some patients with RPLS can experience ongoing neurologic sequelae or death.



       5.9 Proteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome



     In Study 4, severe proteinuria occurred more frequently in patients treated with CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI compared to patients receiving placebo plus FOLFIRI. Severe proteinuria was reported in 3% of patients treated with CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI (including 3 cases [0.6%] of nephrotic syndrome) compared to 0.2% of patients treated with placebo plus FOLFIRI.



    Monitor proteinuria by urine dipstick and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio for the development of worsening of proteinuria during CYRAMZA therapy.



    Withhold CYRAMZA for urine protein levels that are 2 or more grams over 24 hours. Reinitiate CYRAMZA at a reduced dose once the urine protein level returns to less than 2 grams over 24 hours. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for urine protein levels greater than 3 grams over 24 hours or in the setting of nephrotic syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )].  



       5.10 Thyroid Dysfunction



     Monitor thyroid function during treatment with CYRAMZA. In Study 4, the incidence of hypothyroidism reported as an adverse event was 2.6% in the CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI treated patients and 0.9% in the placebo plus FOLFIRI treated patients.



       5.11 Embryofetal Toxicity



     Based on its mechanism of action, CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Animal models link angiogenesis, VEGF and VEGF Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryofetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CYRAMZA and for at 3 least months after the last dose of CYRAMZA [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of raxibacumab has been studied only in healthy volunteers. It has not been studied in patients with inhalational anthrax.



 The safety of raxibacumab has been evaluated in 326 healthy subjects treated with a dose of 40 mg/kg in 3 clinical trials: a drug interaction trial with ciprofloxacin (Study 1), a repeat-dose trial of 20 subjects with the second raxibacumab dose administered >=4 months after the first dose (Study 2), and a placebo-controlled trial evaluating single doses with a subset of subjects receiving 2 raxibacumab doses 14 days apart (Study 3). Raxibacumab was administered to 86 healthy subjects in Study 1. In Study 3, 240 healthy subjects received raxibacumab (217 received 1 dose and 23 received 2 doses) and 80 subjects received placebo.



 The overall safety of raxibacumab was evaluated as an integrated summary of these 3 clinical trials. Of 326 raxibacumab subjects, 283 received single doses, 23 received 2 doses 14 days apart, and 20 received 2 doses more than 4 months apart. The subjects were 18 to 88 years of age, 53% female, 74% white, 17% black/African American, 6% Asian, and 15% Hispanic.



   Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Raxibacumab Infusion  



 Four subjects (1.2%) had their infusion of raxibacumab discontinued for adverse reactions: 2 subjects (neither of whom received diphenhydramine premedication) due to urticaria (mild), and 1 subject each discontinued for clonus (mild) and dyspnea (moderate).



   Most Frequently Reported Adverse Reactions  



 The most frequently reported adverse reactions were rash, pain in extremity, pruritus, and somnolence.

              Rashes  
 

 For all subjects exposed to raxibacumab in clinical trials, the rate of rash was 2.8% (9/326) compared with 1.3% (1/80) of placebo subjects. Mild to moderate infusion-related rashes were reported in 22.2% (6/27) of subjects who did not receive diphenhydramine premedication compared to 3.3% (2/61) of subjects who were premedicated with diphenhydramine in the ciprofloxacin/raxibacumab combination trial (Study 1). In the placebo-controlled raxibacumab study where all subjects received diphenhydramine (Study 3), the rate of rash was 2.5% in both placebo- and raxibacumab-treated subjects.



   Less Common Adverse Reactions  



 Clinically significant adverse reactions that were reported in <1.5% of subjects exposed to raxibacumab and at rates higher than in placebo subjects are listed below:



 *     Blood and lymphatic system : anemia, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy 
 *     Cardiac disorders : palpitations 
 *     Ear and labyrinth : vertigo 
 *     General disorders and administration site : fatigue, infusion site pain, peripheral edema 
 *     Investigations : blood amylase increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, prothrombin time prolonged 
 *     Musculoskeletal and connective tissue : back pain, muscle spasms 
 *     Nervous system : syncope vasovagal 
 *     Psychiatric : insomnia 
 *     Vascular : flushing, hypertension 
      Immunogenicity  
 

 The development of anti-raxibacumab antibodies was evaluated in all subjects receiving single and double doses of raxibacumab in Studies 1, 2, and 3. Immunogenic responses against raxibacumab were not detected in any raxibacumab-treated human subjects following single or repeat doses of raxibacumab.



 The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the immunogenicity assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of any antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors, including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to raxibacumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

  Six serious adverse reactions were reported by four patients during the clinical program. These serious adverse reactions were  Mycobacterium intracellulare  infection; gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis; sinusitis and bronchitis; and  Streptococcus pneumoniae  meningitis [  see Adverse Reactions (  6.3  )  ].



 The most commonly reported adverse reaction associated with ARCALYST was injection-site reaction (ISR) [  see Adverse Reactions (  6.2    )]. The next most commonly reported adverse reaction was upper respiratory infection [  see Adverse Reactions (  6.3  )  ].



 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described herein reflect exposure to ARCALYST in 600 patients, including 85 exposed for at least 6 months and 65 exposed for at least one year. These included patients with CAPS, patients with other diseases, and healthy volunteers. Approximately 60 patients with CAPS have been treated weekly with 160 mg of ARCALYST. The pivotal trial population included 47 patients with CAPS. These patients were between the ages of 22 and 78 years (average 51 years). Thirty-one patients were female and 16 were male. All of the patients were White/Caucasian. Six pediatric patients (12-17 years) were enrolled directly into the open-label extension phase.



   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions reported by patients with CAPS treated with ARCALYST are injection-site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections. (  6.2  ,  6.3  )

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Part A of the clinical trial was conducted in patients with CAPS who were naive to treatment with ARCALYST. Part A of the study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-week study comparing ARCALYST to placebo [  see Clinical Studies (  14  )  ].  Table 1  reflects the frequency of adverse events reported by at least two patients during Part A.

           6.2 Injection-Site Reactions
   In patients with CAPS, the most common and consistently reported adverse event associated with ARCALYST was injection-site reaction (ISR). The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritis, mass, bruising, inflammation, pain, edema, dermatitis, discomfort, urticaria, vesicles, warmth and hemorrhage. Most injection-site reactions lasted for one to two days. No ISRs were assessed as severe, and no patient discontinued study participation due to an ISR.



   6.3 Infections

  During Part A, the incidence of patients reporting infections was greater with ARCALYST (48%) than with placebo (17%). In Part B, randomized withdrawal, the incidence of infections were similar in the ARCALYST (18%) and the placebo patients (22%). Part A of the trial was initiated in the winter months, while Part B was predominantly performed in the summer months.



 In placebo-controlled studies across a variety of patient populations encompassing 360 patients treated with rilonacept and 179 treated with placebo, the incidence of infections was 34% and 27% (2.15 per patient-exposure year and 1.81 per patient-exposure year), respectively, for rilonacept and placebo.



 Serious Infections: One patient receiving ARCALYST for an unapproved indication in another study developed an infection in his olecranon bursa with  Mycobacterium intracellulare  . The patient was on chronic glucocorticoid treatment. The infection occurred after an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection into the bursa with subsequent local exposure to a suspected source of mycobacteria. The patient recovered after the administration of the appropriate antimicrobial therapy. One patient treated for another unapproved indication developed bronchitis/sinusitis, which resulted in hospitalization. One patient died in an open-label study of CAPS from  Streptococcus pneumoniae  meningitis.



   6.4 Malignancies

  [s  ee Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].  



   6.5 Hematologic Events

  One patient in a study in an unapproved indication developed transient neutropenia (ANC < 1 x 10  9  /L) after receiving a large dose (2000 mg intravenously) of ARCALYST. The patient did not experience any infection associated with the neutropenia.



   6.6 Immunogenicity

  Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in patients with CAPS after treatment with ARCALYST. Nineteen of 55 patients (35%) who had received ARCALYST for at least 6 weeks tested positive for treatment-emergent binding antibodies on at least one occasion. Of the 19, seven tested positive at the last assessment (Week 18 or 24 of the open-label extension period), and five patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies on at least one occasion. There was no correlation of antibody activity and either clinical effectiveness or safety.



 The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to the rilonacept receptor domains in specific assays, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. The observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to rilonacept with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.7 Lipid profiles

  Cholesterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Patients with CAPS treated with ARCALYST experienced increases in their mean total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The mean increases from baseline for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were 19 mg/dL, 2 mg/dL, 10 mg/dL, and 57 mg/dL respectively after 6 weeks of open-label therapy. Physicians should monitor the lipid profiles of their patients (for example after 2-3 months) and consider lipid-lowering therapies as needed based upon cardiovascular risk factors and current guidelines.

ARCALYST,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Interleukin-1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections. Serious, life-threatening infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST. Discontinue treatment with ARCALYST if a patient develops a serious infection. Do not initiate treatment with ARCALYST in patients with active or chronic infections. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST administration have been rare. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of ARCALYST and initiate appropriate therapy. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ARCALYST. Prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST, patients should receive all recommended vaccinations. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Infections



  Interleukin -1 (IL-1) blockade may interfere with the immune response to infections. Treatment with another medication that works through inhibition of IL-1 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and serious infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST [ see Clinical Studies (  14  )  ]. There was a greater incidence of infections in patients on ARCALYST compared with placebo. In the controlled portion of the study, one infection was reported as severe, which was bronchitis in a patient on ARCALYST.



 In an open-label extension study, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.3  )  ]. ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Treatment with ARCALYST should not be initiated in patients with an active or chronic infection.



 In clinical studies, ARCALYST has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of an IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Taking ARCALYST with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections.  



 Drugs that affect the immune system by blocking TNF have been associated with an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is possible that taking drugs such as ARCALYST that block IL-1 increases the risk of TB or other atypical or opportunistic infections. Healthcare providers should follow current CDC guidelines both to evaluate for and to treat possible latent tuberculosis infections before initiating therapy with ARCALYST.



    5.2 Immunosuppression



  The impact of treatment with ARCALYST on active and/or chronic infections and the development of malignancies is not known [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.3  )]  . However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including ARCALYST, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies.



    5.3 Immunizations



  Since no data are available on either the efficacy of live vaccines or on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ARCALYST, live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ARCALYST. In addition, because ARCALYST may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens, vaccinations may not be effective in patients receiving ARCALYST. No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccination with inactivated (killed) antigens in patients receiving ARCALYST.



 Because IL-1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections, it is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST adult and pediatric patients receive all recommended vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine. (See current Recommended Immunizations schedules at the website of the Centers for Disease Control. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/).



    5.4 Lipid Profile Changes



  Patients should be monitored for changes in their lipid profiles and provided with medical treatment if warranted [see Adverse Reactions (  6.7  )]  .



    5.5 Hypersensitivity



  Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST administration in the clinical studies were rare. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of ARCALYST should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In five randomized, double-blind, controlled trials, 1,399 subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza received a single dose of RAPIVAB, administered intravenously or intramuscularly, at doses up to 600 mg. Among the 664 subjects receiving RAPIVAB 600 mg (intravenous or intramuscular), the most commonly observed adverse reaction was diarrhea, occurring at a rate of 8% versus 7% in subjects receiving placebo. No subject receiving RAPIVAB 600 mg experienced a serious adverse event and less than 1% discontinued study because of an adverse reaction.



 Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (DAIDS Grade 2-4) listed in Table 2 occurred more frequently in subjects treated with RAPIVAB 600 mg (intravenous or intramuscular) than placebo. Only events occurring at >=2% are included.

         In a subset of subjects with serious influenza requiring hospitalization treated with RAPIVAB 600 mg as monotherapy (N=101) the following adverse reactions were also reported more frequently with RAPIVAB as compared to placebo: constipation (4% versus 2%), insomnia (3% versus 0%), AST increased (3% versus 2%), and hypertension (2% versus 0%).
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of RAPIVAB in Japan. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   EXCERPT:    *  Serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme have occurred with RAPIVAB. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Neuropsychiatric events: Patients with influenza may be at an increased risk of hallucinations, delirium and abnormal behavior early in their illness. Monitor for signs of abnormal behavior. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Rare cases of serious skin reactions, including erythema multiforme, have been reported with RAPIVAB in clinical studies and in postmarketing experience; Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported with RAPIVAB in postmarketing experience. Appropriate treatment should be instituted if a serious skin reaction occurs or is suspected.



    5.2 Neuropsychiatric Events



  Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur in uncomplicated influenza as well.



 There have been postmarketing reports (from Japan) of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury in patients with influenza who were receiving neuraminidase inhibitors, including RAPIVAB. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made, but they appear to be uncommon. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of RAPIVAB to these events has not been established. Patients with influenza should be closely monitored for signs of abnormal behavior.



    5.3 Risk of Bacterial Infections



  There is no evidence for efficacy of RAPIVAB in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. RAPIVAB has not been shown to prevent such complications.



 Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat with antibiotics as appropriate.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of FOLOTYN was evaluated in 111 PTCL patients in a single-arm clinical study in which patients received a starting dose of 30 mg/m  2  once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-week cycles. The median duration of treatment was 70 days (range 1-540 days).

                 Serious Adverse Events  
 

 Forty-four percent of patients (n = 49) experienced a serious adverse event while on study or within 30 days after their last dose of FOLOTYN. The most common serious adverse events (> 3%), regardless of causality, were pyrexia, mucositis, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, dehydration, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia. One death from cardiopulmonary arrest in a patient with mucositis and febrile neutropenia was reported in this trial. Deaths from mucositis, febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and pancytopenia occurred in 1.2% of patients treated on all FOLOTYN trials at doses ranging from 30 to 325 mg/m  2  .



     Discontinuations  



 Twenty-three percent of patients (n = 25) discontinued treatment with FOLOTYN due to adverse reactions. The adverse reactions reported most frequently as the reason for discontinuation of treatment were mucositis (6%, n = 7) and thrombocytopenia (5%, n = 5).



     Dose Modifications  



 The target dose of FOLOTYN was 30 mg/m  2  once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-week cycles. The majority of patients (69%, n = 77) remained at the target dose for the duration of treatment. Overall, 85% of scheduled doses were administered.



   6.2 Post Marketing Experience

  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     Dermatologic Reactions  



 Toxic epidermal necrolysis, sometimes fatal, has been reported during post-marketing use of FOLOTYN. Fatal cases have been reported following the first dose of FOLOTYN, including when a reduced dose is given, and have been reported in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis [  see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  ), and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].

FOLOTYN,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia: Monitor blood counts and omit and/or reduce dose for hematologic toxicities. (  2.2  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Mucositis: Monitor at least weekly. If >= Grade 2 mucositis is observed, omit and/or reduce dose. (  2.2  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Dermatologic reactions: Reactions, including fatal reactions, have occurred and may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor closely, and omit and/or reduce dose or discontinue FOLOTYN. (  2.2  ,  5.3  ) 
 *  Tumor lysis syndrome: Anticipate, monitor, and treat promptly. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Hepatic toxicity: Monitor for toxicity. For liver function test abnormalities Grade 3 or greater, omit until recovery then reduce dose or discontinue therapy as required. (  2.2  ,  5.5  ) 
 *  Risk of increased toxicity with renal impairment: Patients with moderate to severe renal function impairment may be at greater risk for increased exposure and toxicity. Monitor patients for renal function and systemic toxicity and adjust dosing accordingly. Avoid FOLOTYN use in patients with end stage renal disease including those undergoing dialysis unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. (  2.2  ,  5.6  ,  6.2  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Women should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with FOLOTYN. Inform pregnant women of the potential harm to the fetus. (  5.7  ,  8.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression



  FOLOTYN can cause bone marrow suppression, manifested by thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and/or anemia. Monitor complete blood counts and omit and/or reduce the dose based on ANC and platelet count prior to each dose as outlined in Section  2.2     Table 2  . Administer vitamin B12and instruct patients to take folic acid to reduce the risk of treatment-related hematological toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )(  2.2  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



    5.2 Mucositis



  FOLOTYN can cause mucositis. Monitor for mucositis weekly and if >= Grade 2 mucositis is observed, omit and/or reduce the dose as outlined in Section  2.2     Table 1  . Administer vitamin B12and instruct patients to take folic acid to reduce the risk of mucositis [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )(2.2  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



    5.3 Dermatologic Reactions



  FOLOTYN can cause severe dermatologic reactions, which may result in death. These dermatologic reactions have been reported in clinical studies (14/663 patients [2.1%]) and post marketing experience, and have included skin exfoliation, ulceration, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).  They may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment, and may involve skin and subcutaneous sites of known lymphoma.  Monitor patients with dermatologic reactions closely, and if severe, withhold or discontinue FOLOTYN [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  )  ].



    5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  FOLOTYN can cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Monitor patients who are at increased risk of TLS and treat promptly.



    5.5 Hepatic Toxicity



  FOLOTYN can cause hepatic toxicity and liver function test abnormalities. Persistent liver function test abnormalities may be indicators of hepatic toxicity and require dose modification or discontinuation. Monitor liver function tests. Omit dose until recovery, adjust or discontinue therapy based on the severity of the hepatic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  ].



       5.6 Risk of Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Impaired Renal Function



     Patients with moderate to severe renal function impairment may be at greater risk for increased exposure and toxicity. Monitor patients for renal function and systemic toxicity and adjust dosing accordingly.



    Serious adverse drug reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis and mucositis were reported in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing dialysis who were administered FOLOTYN therapy. Avoid FOLOTYN use in patients with end stage renal disease including those undergoing dialysis unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ), Adverse Reactions (  6.2  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  ), and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].



    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  FOLOTYN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. FOLOTYN was embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ].

KRYSTEXXA,adverse reactions,"      6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  

  The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions from pre-marketing controlled clinical trials were anaphylaxis, which occurred at a frequency of 6.5% in patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, compared to none with placebo; infusion reactions, which occurred at a frequency of 26% in patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, compared to 5% treated with placebo; and gout flares, which were more common during the first 3 months of treatment with KRYSTEXXA compared with placebo. All patients in pre-marketing controlled clinical trials were pre-treated with an oral antihistamine, intravenous corticosteroid and/or acetaminophen to prevent anaphylaxis and infusion reaction. Patients also received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or colchicine, or both, for at least 7 days as gout flare prophylaxis before beginning KRYSTEXXA treatment. [  see      Boxed Warning      ,    Warnings and Precautions   (  5.1  ,  5.2  ,  5.3  )]



   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 5% of KRYSTEXXA-treated patients) are gout flares, infusion reactions, nausea, contusion or ecchymosis, nasopharyngitis, constipation, chest pain, anaphylaxis and vomiting. (  6.1  )



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Crealta Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-888-579-7839 (1-888-KRYSTEXXA) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

    6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  

  The data described below reflect exposure to KRYSTEXXA in patients with chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy in two replicate randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 6-month clinical trials: 85 patients were treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks; 84 patients were treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks; and 43 patients were treated with placebo. These patients were between the ages of 23 and 89 years (average 55 years); 173 patients were male and 39 were female; and 143 patients were White/Caucasian, 27 were Black/African American, 24 were Hispanic/Latino and 18 were all other ethnicities. Common co-morbid conditions among the enrolled patients included hypertension (72%), dyslipidemia (49%), chronic kidney disease (28%), diabetes (24%), coronary artery disease (18%), arrhythmia (16%), and cardiac failure/left ventricular dysfunction (12%).



 Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug, and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice.



   Anaphylaxis:  Diagnostic criteria of anaphylaxis were skin or mucosal tissue involvement, and, either airway compromise, and/or reduced blood pressure with or without associated symptoms, and a temporal relationship to KRYSTEXXA or placebo injection with no other identifiable cause. Using these clinical criteria, anaphylaxis was identified in 14 (5.1%) of 273 total patients studied in the clinical program of IV KRYSTEXXA. The frequency was 6.5% for the every 2-week dosing regimen (8 of 123 patients), and 4.8% for the 4-week dosing frequency (6 of 126) of KRYSTEXXA. There were no cases of anaphylaxis in patients receiving placebo. Anaphylaxis generally occurred within 2 hours after treatment. This occurred with patients being pre-treated with an oral antihistamine, intravenous corticosteroid, and acetaminophen. [see    Boxed Warning      ,         Warnings and Precautions       (  5.1  ,  5.2  )]



   Infusion Reactions:  Infusion reactions occurred in 26% of patients in the 2 week dosing regimen group and 41% of patients in the 4 week dosing regimen group, compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Manifestations of these reactions included urticaria (frequency of 10.6%), dyspnea (frequency of 7.1%), chest discomfort (frequency of 9.5%), chest pain (frequency of 9.5%), erythema (frequency of 9.5%), and pruritus (frequency of 9.5%). These manifestations overlap with the symptoms of anaphylaxis, but in a given patient did not occur together to satisfy the clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis. Infusion reactions are thought to result from release of various mediators, such as cytokines. Infusion reactions occurred at any time during a course of treatment with approximately 3% occurring with the first infusion, and approximately 91% occurred during the time of infusion. Some infusion reaction manifestations were reduced with slowing the rate of infusion, or stopping the infusion and restarting the infusion at a slower rate. These infusion reactions occurred with all patients being pre-treated with an oral antihistamine, intravenous corticosteroid and acetaminophen. [  see      Boxed Warning      ,    Warnings and Precautions       (  5.1  ,  5.2  )]



   Gout Flares:  Gout flares were common in the study patients before randomization to treatment, with patients experiencing an average of 10 flares in the preceding 18 months prior to study entry. During the controlled treatment period with KRYSTEXXA or placebo, the frequencies of gout flares were high in all treatment groups, but more so with KRYSTEXXA treatment during the first 3 months of treatment, which seemed to decrease in the subsequent 3 months of treatment. The percentages of patients with any flare for the first 3 months were 74%, 81%, and 51%, for KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks, and placebo, respectively. The percentages of patients with any flare for the subsequent 3 months were 41%, 57%, and 67%, for KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks, and placebo, respectively. Patients received gout flare prophylaxis with colchicine and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) starting at least one week before receiving KRYSTEXXA. [  see    Warnings and Precautions       (  5.3  )]



   Congestive Heart Failure:  Two cases of congestive heart failure exacerbation occurred during the trials in patients receiving treatment with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks. No cases were reported in placebo-treated patients. Four subjects had exacerbations of pre-existing congestive heart failure while receiving KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks during the open-label extension study. [  see    Warnings and Precautions       (  5.4  )].

   b  Most did not occur on the day of infusion and could be related to other factors (e.g. concomitant medications relevant to contusion or ecchymosis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus).



     6.2 Immunogenicity  

  Anti-pegloticase antibodies developed in 92% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks, and 28% for placebo.         Anti-PEG antibodies were also detected in 42% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA.         High anti-pegloticase antibody titer was associated with a failure to maintain pegloticase-induced normalization of uric acid. The impact of anti-PEG antibodies on patients' responses to other PEG-containing therapeutics is unknown.



 There was a higher incidence of infusion reactions in patients with high anti-pegloticase antibody titer: 53% (16 of 30) in the KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks group compared to 6% in patients who had undetectable or low antibody titers.  



 As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity and assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, the comparison of the incidence of antibodies to pegloticase with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

    5.1   Anaphylaxis  



  During pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, anaphylaxis was reported with a frequency of 6.5% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks, compared to none with placebo. Manifestations included wheezing, peri-oral or lingual edema, or hemodynamic instability, with or without rash or urticaria. Cases occurred in patients being pre-treated with one or more doses of an oral antihistamine, an intravenous corticosteroid and/or acetaminophen. This pre-treatment may have blunted or obscured symptoms or signs of anaphylaxis and therefore the reported frequency may be an underestimate. [ See   Adverse Reactions      (  6  )]



 KRYSTEXXA should be administered in a healthcare setting by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Patients should be pre-treated with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Anaphylaxis may occur with any infusion, including a first infusion, and generally manifests within 2 hours of the infusion. However, delayed type hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported. Patients should be closely monitored for an appropriate period of time for anaphylaxis after administration of KRYSTEXXA. Patients should be informed of the symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis and instructed to seek immediate medical care should anaphylaxis occur after discharge from the healthcare setting.



 The risk of anaphylaxis is higher in patients whose uric acid level increases to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to infusions and consider discontinuing treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL. Because of the possibility that concomitant use of oral urate-lowering therapy and KRYSTEXXA may potentially blunt the rise of serum uric acid levels, it is recommended that before starting KRYSTEXXA patients discontinue oral urate-lowering medications and not institute therapy with oral urate-lowering agents while taking KRYSTEXXA.



     5.2   Infusion Reactions  



  During pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, infusion reactions were reported in 26% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, and 41% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks, compared to 5% of patients treated with placebo. These infusion reactions occurred in patients being pre-treated with an oral antihistamine, intravenous corticosteroid and/or acetaminophen. This pre-treatment may have blunted or obscured symptoms or signs of infusion reactions and therefore the reported frequency may be an underestimate. [ See       Adverse Reactions      (  6  )]



 KRYSTEXXA should be administered in a healthcare setting by healthcare providers prepared to manage infusion reactions. Patients should be pre-treated with antihistamines and corticosteroids. KRYSTEXXA should be infused slowly over no less than 120 minutes. In the event of an infusion reaction, the infusion should be slowed, or stopped and restarted at a slower rate.



 The risk of infusion reaction is higher in patients whose uric acid level increases to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to infusions and consider discontinuing treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL. Because of the possibility that concomitant use of oral urate-lowering therapy and KRYSTEXXA may potentially blunt the rise of serum uric acid levels, it is recommended that before starting KRYSTEXXA patients discontinue oral urate-lowering medications and not institute therapy with oral urate-lowering agents while taking KRYSTEXXA.



     5.   3   Gout Flares  



  Gout flares may occur after initiation of KRYSTEXXA. [ see   Adverse Reactions      (  6.1  )]  An increase in gout flares is frequently observed upon initiation of anti-hyperuricemic therapy, due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Gout flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended starting at least 1 week before initiation of KRYSTEXXA therapy and lasting at least 6 months, unless medically contraindicated or not tolerated.                KRYSTEXXA does not need to be discontinued because of a gout flare. The gout flare should be managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. [ see   Dosage and Administration  (  2  )] 



     5.   4       Congestive Heart Failure  



  KRYSTEXXA has not been formally studied in patients with congestive heart failure, but some patients in the clinical trials experienced exacerbation. [ see   Adverse Reactions      (  6.1  )] Exercise caution when using KRYSTEXXA in patients who have congestive heart failure and monitor patients closely following infusion.



     5.   5   Re-treatment with KRYSTEXXA  



  No controlled trial data are available on the safety and efficacy of re-treatment with KRYSTEXXA after stopping treatment for longer than 4 weeks.           Due to the immunogenicity of KRYSTEXXA, patients receiving re-treatment may be at increased risk of anaphylaxis and infusion reactions. Therefore, patients receiving re-treatment after a drug-free interval should be monitored carefully. [ see   Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )]

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Based on data from nine Phase 2/3 studies that administered multiple doses (seven placebo- and/or active-controlled, one noncontrolled and one Phase 3 active-controlled safety study) the most common adverse reactions (reported by >=10% in any NUCYNTA  (r)  dose group) were: nausea, dizziness, vomiting and somnolence.



 The most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions in the studies described above (reported by >=1% in any NUCYNTA  (r)  dose group) were dizziness (2.6% vs. 0.5%), nausea (2.3% vs. 0.6%), vomiting (1.4% vs. 0.2%), somnolence (1.3% vs. 0.2%) and headache (0.9% vs. 0.2%) for NUCYNTA  (r)  - and placebo-treated patients, respectively.



 Seventy-six percent of NUCYNTA  (r)  -treated patients from the nine studies experienced adverse events.



 NUCYNTA  (r)  was studied in multiple-dose, active- or placebo-controlled studies, or noncontrolled studies (n = 2178), in single-dose studies (n = 870), in open-label study extension (n = 483) and in Phase 1 studies (n = 597). Of these, 2034 patients were treated with doses of 50 mg to 100 mg of NUCYNTA  (r)  dosed every 4 to 6 hours.



 The data described below reflect exposure to NUCYNTA  (r)  in 3161 patients, including 449 exposed for 45 days. NUCYNTA  (r)  was studied primarily in placebo- and active-controlled studies (n = 2266, and n = 2944, respectively). The population was 18 to 85 years old (mean age 46 years), 68% were female, 75% white and 67% were postoperative. Most patients received NUCYNTA  (r)  doses of 50 mg, 75 mg, or 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours.

 In the pooled safety data, the overall incidence of adverse reactions increased with increased dose of NUCYNTA  (r)  , as did the percentage of patients with adverse reactions of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and pruritus.



   6.2 Post-marketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of NUCYNTA  (r)  . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably.



   Gastrointestinal disorders:  diarrhea



   Nervous system disorders:  headache



   Psychiatric disorders:  hallucination, suicidal ideation, panic attack



   Cardiac disorders:  palpitations



 Anaphylaxis, angioedema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported very rarely with ingredients contained in NUCYNTA  (r)  . Advise patients how to recognize such reactions and when to seek medical attention.

   5.1 Abuse Potential



   NUCYNTA  (r)  contains tapentadol, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Tapentadol can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing NUCYNTA  (r)  in situations where there is concern about increased risks of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain.  



  Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing NUCYNTA  (r)  . The risk for opioid abuse is increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with opioids; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because these drugs carry a risk for addiction even under appropriate medical use.  



 Misuse or abuse of NUCYNTA  (r)  by crushing, chewing, snorting or injecting will pose a significant risk that could result in overdose and death [see  Overdosage (10)  ].  



 Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)  ]  .



    5.2 Life Threatening Respiratory Depression



   Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including NUCYNTA  (r)  . Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a ""sighing"" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see  Overdosage (10)  ]  .  



  Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom NUCYNTA  (r)  was prescribed and to keep NUCYNTA  (r)  out of the reach of children, as such inappropriate use may result in fatal respiratory depression.  



  Patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercarbia or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, central nervous system (CNS) depression, or coma may be at increased risk for increased airway resistance and decreased respiratory drive to the point of apnea even with usual therapeutic doses of NUCYNTA  (r)  . Consider the use of alternative non-mu-opioid agonist analgesics and use NUCYNTA  (r)  only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. If respiratory depression occurs, treat the patient for mu-opioid agonist-induced respiratory depression [see  Overdosage (10.2)  ]  . To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of NUCYNTA  (r)  is essential [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  .  



    5.3 Accidental Exposure



   Accidental ingestion of NUCYNTA  (r)  , especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of tapentadol.  



    5.4 Interactions with Alcohol, Other Opioids, and Drugs of Abuse



   Due to its mu-opioid agonist activity, NUCYNTA  (r)  may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma or death [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  . Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol, other opioids, or drugs of abuse while on NUCYNTA  (r)  therapy [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .  



    5.5 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients



   Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Therefore, closely monitor such patients, particularly when NUCYNTA  (r)  is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  



    5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease



   Monitor for respiratory depression those patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or pre-existing respiratory depression, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of NUCYNTA  (r)  may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible.  



    5.7 Interactions with CNS Depressants and Illicit Drugs



  Hypotension, and profound sedation, coma or respiratory depression may result if NUCYNTA  (r)  is used concomitantly with other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, muscle relaxants, other opioids and illicit drugs). When considering the use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, consider the patient's use, if any, of alcohol and/or illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If NUCYNTA  (r)  therapy is to be initiated in a patient taking a CNS depressant, start with a lower NUCYNTA  (r)  dose than usual and monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .



    5.8 Hypotensive Effect



   NUCYNTA  (r)  may cause severe hypotension. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after the dose of NUCYNTA  (r)  . In patients with circulatory shock, NUCYNTA  (r)  may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with circulatory shock.  



    5.9 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure



   Monitor patients taking NUCYNTA  (r)  who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression. NUCYNTA  (r)  may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.  



 Avoid the use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    5.10 Seizures



   NUCYNTA  (r)  has not been evaluated in patients with a predisposition to a seizure disorder, and such patients were excluded from clinical studies. The active ingredient tapentadol in NUCYNTA  (r)  may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during NUCYNTA  (r)  therapy.  



    5.11 Serotonin Syndrome Risk



   Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported with the concurrent use of tapentadol and serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs comprise Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g. mirtazapine, trazodone, and tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs). This may occur within the recommended dose. Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and can be fatal [see  Drug Interactions (7.4)  ]  .  



    5.12 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  NUCYNTA  (r)  is contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The tapentadol in NUCYNTA  (r)  may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



    5.13 Withdrawal



  Withdrawal symptoms may occur if NUCYNTA  (r)  is discontinued abruptly. These symptoms may include: anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely, hallucinations. Withdrawal symptoms may be reduced by tapering NUCYNTA  (r)   [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)  ]  .



    5.14 Driving and Operating Heavy Machinery



   NUCYNTA  (r)  may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of NUCYNTA  (r)  and know how they will react to the medication.  



    5.15 Hepatic Impairment



  A study with NUCYNTA  (r)  in subjects with hepatic impairment showed higher serum concentrations of tapentadol than in those with normal hepatic function. Avoid use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Reduce the dose of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression when receiving NUCYNTA  (r)  .



    5.16 Renal Impairment



   Use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended due to accumulation of a metabolite formed by glucuronidation of tapentadol. The clinical relevance of the elevated metabolite is not known [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .

ACTEMRA,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice.



   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5%): upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension, increased ALT, injection site reactions.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treated with Intravenous ACTEMRA (ACTEMRA-IV)

  The ACTEMRA-IV data in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) includes 5 double-blind, controlled, multicenter studies. In these studies, patients received doses of ACTEMRA-IV 8 mg per kg monotherapy (288 patients), ACTEMRA-IV 8 mg per kg in combination with DMARDs (including methotrexate) (1582 patients), or ACTEMRA-IV 4 mg per kg in combination with methotrexate (774 patients).



 The all exposure population includes all patients in registration studies who received at least one dose of ACTEMRA-IV. Of the 4009 patients in this population, 3577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3309 for at least one year; 2954 received treatment for at least 2 years and 2189 for 3 years.



 All patients in these studies had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The study population had a mean age of 52 years, 82% were female and 74% were Caucasian.



 The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  . The most commonly reported adverse reactions in controlled studies up to 24 weeks (occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with ACTEMRA-IV monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT.



 The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies was 5% for patients taking ACTEMRA-IV and 3% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that required discontinuation of ACTEMRA-IV were increased hepatic transaminase values (per protocol requirement) and serious infections.



     Overall Infections  



 In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, the rate of infections in the ACTEMRA-IV monotherapy group was 119 events per 100 patient-years and was similar in the methotrexate monotherapy group. The rate of infections in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg ACTEMRA-IV plus DMARD group was 133 and 127 events per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 112 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo plus DMARD group. The most commonly reported infections (5% to 8% of patients) were upper respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis.



 The overall rate of infections with ACTEMRA-IV in the all exposure population remained consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies.



     Serious Infections  



 In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections in the ACTEMRA-IV monotherapy group was 3.6 per 100 patient-years compared to 1.5 per 100 patient-years in the methotrexate group. The rate of serious infections in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg ACTEMRA-IV plus DMARD group was 4.4 and 5.3 events per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 3.9 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo plus DMARD group.



 In the all-exposure population, the overall rate of serious infections remained consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



     Gastrointestinal Perforations  



 During the 24 week, controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.26 events per 100 patient-years with ACTEMRA-IV therapy.



 In the all-exposure population, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation remained consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. Reports of gastrointestinal perforation were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis including generalized purulent peritonitis, lower GI perforation, fistula and abscess. Most patients who developed gastrointestinal perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  . The relative contribution of these concomitant medications versus ACTEMRA-IV to the development of GI perforations is not known.



       Infusion Reactions    



 In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, adverse events associated with the infusion (occurring during or within 24 hours of the start of infusion) were reported in 8% and 7% of patients in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg ACTEMRA-IV plus DMARD group, respectively, compared to 5% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. The most frequently reported event on the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg dose during the infusion was hypertension (1% for both doses), while the most frequently reported event occurring within 24 hours of finishing an infusion were headache (1% for both doses) and skin reactions (1% for both doses), including rash, pruritus and urticaria. These events were not treatment limiting.



       Anaphylaxis    



 Hypersensitivity reactions requiring treatment discontinuation, including anaphylaxis, associated with ACTEMRA-IV were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) in the 24 week, controlled trials and in 0.2% (8 out of 4009) in the all-exposure population. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fourth infusion of ACTEMRA-IV. Appropriate medical treatment should be available for immediate use in the event of a serious hypersensitivity reaction  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  .



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



     Neutropenia  



 In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1000 per mm  3  occurred in 1.8% and 3.4% of patients in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg ACTEMRA-IV plus DMARD group, respectively, compared to 0.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Approximately half of the instances of ANC below 1000 per mm  3  occurred within 8 weeks of starting therapy. Decreases in neutrophil counts below 500 per mm  3  occurred in 0.4% and 0.3% of patients in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg ACTEMRA-IV plus DMARD, respectively, compared to 0.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. There was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1000 per mm  3  and the occurrence of serious infections.



 In the all-exposure population, the pattern and incidence of decreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week controlled clinical studies  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



     Thrombocytopenia  



 In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, decreases in platelet counts below 100,000 per mm  3  occurred in 1.3% and 1.7% of patients on 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg ACTEMRA-IV plus DMARD, respectively, compared to 0.5% of patients on placebo plus DMARD, without associated bleeding events.



 In the all-exposure population, the pattern and incidence of decreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week controlled clinical studies  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



     Elevated Liver Enzymes  



 Liver enzyme abnormalities are summarized in    Table 1    . In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of ACTEMRA-IV, or reduction in ACTEMRA-IV dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ]  . These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .

            In the all-exposure population, the elevations in ALT and AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week, controlled clinical trials
 

     Lipids  



 Elevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) were first assessed at 6 weeks following initiation of ACTEMRA-IV in the controlled 24 week clinical trials. Increases were observed at this time point and remained stable thereafter. Increases in triglycerides to levels above 500 mg per dL were rarely observed. Changes in other lipid parameters from baseline to week 24 were evaluated and are summarized below:



 *  -  Mean LDL increased by 13 mg per dL in the ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg+DMARD arm, 20 mg per dL in the ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg+DMARD, and 25 mg per dL in ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg monotherapy. 
 *  -  Mean HDL increased by 3 mg per dL in the ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg+DMARD arm, 5 mg per dL in the ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg+DMARD, and 4 mg per dL in ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg monotherapy. 
 *  -  Mean LDL/HDL ratio increased by an average of 0.14 in the ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg+DMARD arm, 0.15 in the ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg+DMARD, and 0.26 in ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg monotherapy. 
 *  -  ApoB/ApoA1 ratios were essentially unchanged in ACTEMRA-treated patients. 
    Elevated lipids responded to lipid lowering agents.
 

 In the all-exposure population, the elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week, controlled clinical trials.



       Immunogenicity    



 In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, a total of 2876 patients have been tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies. Forty-six patients (2%) developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies, of whom 5 had an associated, medically significant, hypersensitivity reaction leading to withdrawal. Thirty patients (1%) developed neutralizing antibodies.



 The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to tocilizumab in specific assays. The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors, including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to tocilizumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



       Malignancies    



 During the 24 week, controlled period of the studies, 15 malignancies were diagnosed in patients receiving ACTEMRA-IV, compared to 8 malignancies in patients in the control groups. Exposure-adjusted incidence was similar in the ACTEMRA-IV groups (1.32 events per 100 patient-years) and in the placebo plus DMARD group (1.37 events per 100 patient-years).



 In the all-exposure population, the rate of malignancies remained consistent with the rate observed in the 24 week, controlled period  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  .



       Other Adverse Reactions    



 Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on 4 or 8 mg per kg ACTEMRA-IV plus DMARD and at least 1% greater than that observed in patients on placebo plus DMARD are summarized in    Table 2  .

   6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treated with Subcutaneous ACTEMRA (ACTEMRA-SC)

  The ACTEMRA-SC data in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) includes 2 double-blind, controlled, multicenter studies. Study SC-I was a non-inferiority study that compared the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab 162 mg administered every week subcutaneously (SC) and 8 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every four weeks in 1262 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis. Study SC-II was a placebo controlled superiority study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab 162 mg administered every other week SC or placebo in 656 patients. All patients in both studies received background non-biologic DMARDs.



 The safety observed for ACTEMRA administered subcutaneously was consistent with the known safety profile of intravenous ACTEMRA, with the exception of injection site reactions, which were more common with ACTEMRA-SC compared with placebo SC injections (IV arm).



       Injection Site Reactions    



 In the 6-month control period, in SC-I, the frequency of injection site reactions was 10.1% (64/631) and 2.4% (15/631) for the weekly ACTEMRA-SC and placebo SC (IV-arm) groups, respectively. In SC-II, the frequency of injection site reactions was 7.1% (31/437) and 4.1% (9/218) for the every other week SC ACTEMRA and placebo groups, respectively. These injection site reactions (including erythema, pruritus, pain and hematoma) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority resolved without any treatment and none necessitated drug discontinuation.



       Immunogenicity    



 In the 6-month control period in SC-I, 0.8% (5/625) in the ACTEMRA-SC arm and 0.8% (5/627) in the IV arm developed anti-tocilizumab antibodies; of these, all developed neutralizing antibodies. In SC-II, 1.6% (7/434) in the ACTEMRA-SC arm compared with 1.4 % (3/217) in the placebo arm developed anti- tocilizumab antibodies; of these, 1.4% (6/434) in the ACTEMRA-SC arm and 0.5% (1/217) in the placebo arm also developed neutralizing antibodies.



 A total of 1454 (>99%) patients who received ACTEMRA-SC in the all exposure group have been tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies. Thirteen patients (0.9%) developed anti-tocilizumab antibodies, and, of these, 12 patients (0.8%) developed neutralizing antibodies.



 The rate is consistent with previous intravenous experience. No correlation of antibody development to adverse events or loss of clinical response was observed.



       Laboratory Abnormalities    



     Neutropenia  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the 6-month controlled clinical trials, a decrease in neutrophil count below 1 * 10  9  /L occurred in 2.9% and 3.7% of patients receiving ACTEMRA-SC weekly and every other week, respectively.



 There was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1 * 10  9  /L and the occurrence of serious infections.



     Thrombocytopenia  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the ACTEMRA-SC 6-month controlled clinical trials, none of the patients had a decrease in platelet count to <=50 * 10  3  /mcL.



     Elevated Liver Enzymes  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the 6-month controlled clinical trials, elevation in ALT or AST >=3 * ULN occurred in 6.5% and 1.4% of patients, respectively, receiving ACTEMRA-SC weekly and 3.4% and 0.7% receiving ACTEMRA SC every other week.



     Lipids  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the ACTEMRA-SC 6-month clinical trials, 19% of patients dosed weekly and 19.6% of patients dosed every other week and 10.2% of patients on placebo experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol > 6.2 mmol/l (240 mg/dL), with 9%, 10.4% and 5.1% experiencing a sustained increase in LDL to 4.1 mmol/l (160 mg/dL) receiving ACTEMRA-SC weekly, every other week and placebo, respectively.



   6.3 Clinical Trials Experience in Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Treated With Intravenous ACTEMRA (ACTEMRA-IV)

  The safety of ACTEMRA-IV was studied in 188 pediatric patients 2 to 17 years of age with PJIA who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to methotrexate. The total patient exposure in the ACTEMRA-IV all exposure population (defined as patients who received at least one dose of ACTEMRA-IV) was 184.4 patient years. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking oral corticosteroids and almost 80% were taking methotrexate. In general, the types of adverse drug reactions in patients with PJIA were consistent with those seen in RA and SJIA patients [  see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  and  6.4)    ].



     Infections  



 The rate of infections in the ACTEMRA-IV all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The most common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate of serious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing less than 30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing at or above 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was also numerically higher in patients weighing less than 30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21%) compared to patients weighing at or above 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (8%).



     Infusion Reactions  



 In PJIA patients, infusion-related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the ACTEMRA-IV all exposure population, 11 patients (6%) experienced an event during the infusion, and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an infusion. The most common events occurring during infusion were headache, nausea and hypotension, and occurring within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse drug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and SJIA patients  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  and  6.4)  ]  .



 No clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported.



     Immunogenicity  



 One patient, in the 10 mg/kg less than 30 kg group, developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies without developing a hypersensitivity reaction and subsequently withdrew from the study.



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



     Neutropenia  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the ACTEMRA-IV all exposure population, a decrease in neutrophil counts below 1 * 10  9  per L occurred in 3.7% of patients.



 There was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1 * 10  9  per L and the occurrence of serious infections.



     Thrombocytopenia  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the ACTEMRA-IV all exposure population, 1% of patients had a decrease in platelet count at or less than 50 * 10  3  per mcL without associated bleeding events.



     Elevated Liver Enzymes  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the ACTEMRA-IV all exposure population, elevation in ALT or AST at or greater than 3 * ULN occurred in 4% and less than 1% of patients, respectively.



     Lipids  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, elevation in total cholesterol greater than 1.5-2 * ULN occurred in one patient (0.5%) and elevation in LDL greater than 1.5-2 * ULN occurred in one patient (0.5%).



   6.4 Clinical Trials Experience in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Treated with Intravenous ACTEMRA (ACTEMRA-IV)

  The data described below reflect exposure to ACTEMRA-IV in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 112 pediatric patients with SJIA 2 to 17 years of age who had an inadequate clinical response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking 0.3 mg/kg/day corticosteroids or more, and almost 70% were taking methotrexate. The trial included a 12 week controlled phase followed by an open-label extension. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled portion of the clinical study 75 patients received treatment with ACTEMRA-IV (8 or 12 mg per kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with ACTEMRA-IV in the open-label extension phase.



 The most common adverse events (at least 5%) seen in ACTEMRA-IV treated patients in the 12 week controlled portion of the study were: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea.



       Infections    



 In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the ACTEMRA-IV group was 345 per 100 patient-years and 287 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of infections was 304 per 100 patient-years.



 In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the ACTEMRA-IV group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of serious infections was 11.4 per 100 patient years. The most commonly reported serious infections included pneumonia, gastroenteritis, varicella, and otitis media.



       Macrophage Activation Syndrome    



 In the 12 week controlled study, no patient in any treatment group experienced macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) while on assigned treatment; 3 per 112 (3%) developed MAS during open-label treatment with ACTEMRA-IV. One patient in the placebo group escaped to ACTEMRA-IV 12 mg per kg at Week 2 due to severe disease activity, and ultimately developed MAS at Day 70. Two additional patients developed MAS during the long-term extension. All 3 patients had ACTEMRA-IV dose interrupted (2 patients) or discontinued (1 patient) for the MAS event, received treatment, and the MAS resolved without sequelae. Based on a limited number of cases, the incidence of MAS does not appear to be elevated in the ACTEMRA-IV SJIA clinical development experience; however no definitive conclusions can be made.



       Infusion Reactions    



 Patients were not premedicated, however most patients were on concomitant corticosteroids as part of their background treatment for SJIA. Infusion related reactions were defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours after an infusion. In the 12 week controlled phase, 4% of ACTEMRA-IV and 0% of placebo treated patients experienced events occurring during infusion. One event (angioedema) was considered serious and life-threatening, and the patient was discontinued from study treatment.



 Within 24 hours after infusion, 16% of patients in the ACTEMRA-IV treatment group and 5% of patients in the placebo group experienced an event. In the ACTEMRA-IV group the events included rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and headache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered serious.



       Anaphylaxis    



 Anaphylaxis was reported in 1 out of 112 patients (less than 1%) treated with ACTEMRA-IV during the controlled and open label extension study  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  .



       Immunogenicity    



 All 112 patients were tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies: one of these patients experienced serious adverse events of urticaria and angioedema consistent with an anaphylactic reaction which led to withdrawal; the other patient developed macrophage activation syndrome while on escape therapy and was discontinued from the study.



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



     Neutropenia  



 During routine monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, a decrease in neutrophil below 1 * 10  9  per L occurred in 7% of patients in the ACTEMRA-IV group, and in no patients in the placebo group. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, a decreased neutrophil count occurred in 17% of the ACTEMRA-IV group. There was no clear relationship between decrease in neutrophils below 1 * 10  9  per L and the occurrence of serious infections.



     Thrombocytopenia  



 During routine monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, 1% of patients in the ACTEMRA-IV group and 3% in the placebo group had a decrease in platelet count to no more than 100 * 10  3  per mcL.



 In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, decreased platelet count occurred in 4% of patients in the ACTEMRA-IV group, with no associated bleeding.



     Elevated Liver Enzymes  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in ALT or AST at or above 3* ULN occurred in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively in the ACTEMRA-IV group and in 0% of placebo patients.



 In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the elevation in ALT or AST at or above 3* ULN occurred in 13% and 5% of ACTEMRA-IV treated patients, respectively.



     Lipids  



 During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in total cholesterol greater than 1.5* ULN - 2x ULN occurred in 1.5% of the ACTEMRA-IV group and in 0% of placebo patients. Elevation in LDL greater than 1.5* ULN - 2x ULN occurred in 1.9% of patients in the ACTEMRA-IV group and 0% of the placebo group.



 In the open label extension study over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the pattern and incidence of elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with the 12 week controlled study data.



   6.5 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of intravenous ACTEMRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS

    WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS  

    Patients treated with ACTEMRA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.   



   If a serious infection develops, interrupt ACTEMRA until the infection is controlled.   



   Reported infections include:   



 *  Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before ACTEMRA use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to ACTEMRA use. 
 *  Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, and pneumocystis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. 
 *  Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens. 
      The risks and benefits of treatment with ACTEMRA should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.   
 

   Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with ACTEMRA, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .   



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS  



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial, invasive fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections have occurred in patients receiving ACTEMRA. (5.1)

   5.1 Serious Infections



  Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including ACTEMRA for rheumatoid arthritis. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystosis were reported with ACTEMRA. Other serious infections, not reported in clinical studies, may also occur (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, listeriosis). Patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids which in addition to rheumatoid arthritis may predispose them to infections.



 Do not administer ACTEMRA in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating ACTEMRA in patients:



 *  with chronic or recurrent infection; 
 *  who have been exposed to tuberculosis; 
 *  with a history of serious or an opportunistic infection; 
 *  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or 
 *  with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. 
    Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with ACTEMRA, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reactants [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  , and  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .
 

 Hold ACTEMRA if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with ACTEMRA should undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and closely monitor the patient.



    Tuberculosis  



 Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating ACTEMRA.



 Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of ACTEMRA in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.



 Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.



 It is recommended that patients be screened for latent tuberculosis infection prior to starting ACTEMRA. The incidence of tuberculosis in worldwide clinical development programs is 0.1%. Patients with latent tuberculosis should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating ACTEMRA.



    Viral Reactivation  



 Viral reactivation has been reported with immunosuppressive biologic therapies and cases of herpes zoster exacerbation were observed in clinical studies with ACTEMRA. No cases of Hepatitis B reactivation were observed in the trials; however patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded.



    5.2 Gastrointestinal Perforations



  Events of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical trials, primarily as complications of diverticulitis in RA patients. Use ACTEMRA with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation. Promptly evaluate patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.3 Laboratory Parameters



   Rheumatoid Arthritis  



    Neutropenia  



 Treatment with ACTEMRA was associated with a higher incidence of neutropenia. Infections have been uncommonly reported in association with treatment-related neutropenia in long-term extension studies and postmarketing clinical experience.



 *  -  It is not recommended to initiate ACTEMRA treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count, i.e., absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 2000 per mm  3  . In patients who develop an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 per mm  3  treatment is not recommended. 
 *  -   Monitor neutrophils 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ] . For recommended modifications based on ANC results see [  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ] .  
       Thrombocytopenia  
 

 Treatment with ACTEMRA was associated with a reduction in platelet counts. Treatment-related reduction in platelets was not associated with serious bleeding events in clinical trials [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  .



 *  -  It is not recommended to initiate ACTEMRA treatment in patients with a platelet count below 100,000 per mm  3  . In patients who develop a platelet count less than 50,000 per mm  3  treatment is not recommended. 
 *  -   Monitor platelets 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on platelet counts see [  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ] .  
       Elevated Liver Enzymes  
 

 Treatment with ACTEMRA was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations. These elevations did not result in apparent permanent or clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical trials [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  . Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with ACTEMRA.



 In one case, a patient who had received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg monotherapy without elevations in transaminases experienced elevation in AST to above 10* ULN and elevation in ALT to above 16* ULN when MTX was initiated in combination with ACTEMRA. Transaminases normalized when both treatments were held, but elevations recurred when MTX and ACTEMRA were restarted at lower doses. Elevations resolved when MTX and ACTEMRA were discontinued.



 *  -  It is not recommended to initiate ACTEMRA treatment in patients with elevated transaminases ALT or AST greater than 1.5* ULN. In patients who develop elevated ALT or AST greater than 5* ULN treatment is not recommended. 
 *  -   Monitor ALT and AST levels 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. When clinically indicated, other liver function tests such as bilirubin should be considered. For recommended modifications based on transaminases see [  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ] .  
        Lipid Abnormalities    
 

 Treatment with ACTEMRA was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or HDL cholesterol [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  .



 *  -  Assess lipid parameters approximately 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of ACTEMRA therapy, then at approximately 24 week intervals. 
 *  -  Manage patients according to clinical guidelines [e.g., National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP)] for the management of hyperlipidemia. 
       Polyarticular and Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  
 

 A similar pattern of liver enzyme elevation, low neutrophil count, low platelet count and lipid elevations is noted with ACTEMRA treatment in the PJIA and SJIA populations. Monitor neutrophils, platelets, ALT and AST at the time of the second infusion and thereafter every 4 to 8 weeks for PJIA and every 2 to 4 weeks for SJIA. Monitor lipids as above for RA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ]  .



    5.4 Immunosuppression



  The impact of treatment with ACTEMRA on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were observed in clinical studies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . ACTEMRA is an immunosuppressant, and treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies.



    5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis



   Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in association with ACTEMRA [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  and anaphylactic events with a fatal outcome have been reported with intravenous infusion of ACTEMRA. Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) of patients in the 6-month controlled trials of intravenous ACTEMRA, 0.2% (8 out of 4009) of patients in the intravenous all-exposure RA population, 0.7% (8 out of 1068) in the subcutaneous 6-month controlled RA trials, and in 0.7% (10 out of 1465) of patients in the subcutaneous all-exposure population. In the SJIA controlled trial with intravenous ACTEMRA, 1 out of 112 patients (0.9%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. In the PJIA controlled trial with intravenous ACTEMRA, 0 out of 188 patients (0%) in the ACTEMRA all-exposure population experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. Reactions that required treatment discontinuation included generalized erythema, rash, and uticaria. Injection site reactions were categorized separately [s ee  Adverse Reactions (6)    ].  



  In the postmarketing setting, events of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death have occurred in patients treated with a range of doses of intravenous ACTEMRA, with or without concomitant arthritis therapies.  Events have occurred in patients who received premedication. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis events, have occurred both with and without previous hypersensitivity reactions and as early as the first infusion of ACTEMRA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.5)  ]  . ACTEMRA for intravenous use should only be infused by a healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage anaphylaxis. For ACTEMRA subcutaneous injection, advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop administration of ACTEMRA immediately and discontinue ACTEMRA permanently. Do not administer ACTEMRA to patients with known hypersensitivity to ACTEMRA [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.6 Demyelinating Disorders



  The impact of treatment with ACTEMRA on demyelinating disorders is not known, but multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy were reported rarely in RA clinical studies. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of demyelinating disorders. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of ACTEMRA in patients with preexisting or recent onset demyelinating disorders.



    5.7 Active Hepatic Disease and Hepatic Impairment



  Treatment with ACTEMRA is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .



    5.8 Vaccinations



  Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with ACTEMRA as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving ACTEMRA.



 No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccination in patients receiving ACTEMRA. Because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the normal immune response to new antigens, it is recommended that all patients, particularly PJIA and SJIA patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating ACTEMRA therapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of ACTEMRA therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and varying lengths of time, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.



 The most commonly observed adverse reactions in VIIBRYD-treated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in placebo-controlled studies (incidence >= 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and insomnia.



     Patient Exposure  



 The safety of VIIBRYD was evaluated in 3,007 patients (18-70 years of age) diagnosed with MDD who participated in clinical studies, representing 676 patient-years of exposure. In an open-label 52 week study at 40 mg daily, 599 patients were exposed to VIIBRYD for a total of 348 patient-years.



 The adverse reaction information presented below was derived from studies of VIIBRYD 20 mg and 40 mg daily in patients with MDD including:



 *  Four placebo-controlled 8 to 10-week studies in 2,233 patients, including 1,266 VIIBRYD-treated patients; and 
 *  An open-label 52-week study of 599 VIIBRYD-treated patients. 
    These studies included a titration period of 10 mg daily for 7 days, followed by 20 mg daily for 7 days or to 40 mg daily over 2 weeks. In these clinical trials, VIIBRYD was administered with food.
 

     Adverse reactions reported as reasons for discontinuation of treatment  



 In these studies, 7.3% of the VIIBRYD-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 3.5% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of the VIIBRYD-treated patients in the placebo-controlled studies was nausea (1.4%).



     Common adverse reactions in placebo-controlled MDD studies  



   Table 2  shows the incidence of common adverse reactions occuring in >= 2% of VIIBRYD-treated patients and greater than the rate of placebo-treated patients in MDD Studies. There were no dose-related adverse reactions between 20 mg and 40 mg reported.

   EXCERPT:    *  Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRI, SNRI, triptans), but also when taken alone. If it occurs, discontinue VIIBRYD and initiate supportive treatment (  5.2  ) 
 *  Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may increase this risk (  5.3  ) 
 *  Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder (  5.4  ). 
 *  Seizures: Can occur with treatment. Use with caution in patients with a seizure disorder (  5.6  ). 
 *  Angle Closure Glaucoma: Avoid use of antidepressants, including VIIBRYD, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults



  In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients, and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in patients age 24 years and younger was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in  Table 1  .



 No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide.

  Age Range (years)     Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated

        It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression.
 

 Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing VIIBRYD, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.



       5.2 Serotonin Syndrome



     SNRIs and SSRIs, including VIIBRYD, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications (  4  ) and Drug Interactions (  7  )].  Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome were noted in 0.1% of MDD patients treated with VIIBRYD in premarketing clinical trials.



    Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).



    The concomitant use of VIIBRYD with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate VIIBRYD in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking VIIBRYD, discontinue VIIBRYD before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (  4  ), Drug Interactions (  7.1  )].  



    Monitor all patients taking VIIBRYD for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with VIIBRYD and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of VIIBRYD with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.



    5.3 Increased Risk of Bleeding



  Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including VIIBRYD, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.



 Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of VIIBRYD and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing VIIBRYD.



    5.4 Activation of Mania or Hypomania



  In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with VIIBRYD or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.1% of undiagnosed patients treated with VIIBRYD. Prior to initiating treatment with VIIBRYD, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



    5.5 Discontinuation Syndrome



  Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



    5.6 Seizures



  VIIBRYD has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. VIIBRYD should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.



       5.7 Angle-Closure Glaucoma



     The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including VIIBRYD may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including VIIBRYD, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.



    5.8 Hyponatremia



  Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including VIIBRYD. Cases of serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).



 In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue VIIBRYD and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In three Phase 3 clinical trials, 616 subjects were exposed to LUZU Cream, 1%: 305 with interdigital tinea pedis and 311 subjects with tinea cruris. Subjects with interdigital tinea pedis or tinea cruris applied LUZU Cream, 1% or vehicle cream once daily for 14 days or 7 days, respectively, to affected and adjacent areas. During clinical trials with LUZU Cream, 1%, the most common adverse reactions were application site reactions which occurred in less than 1% of subjects in both the LUZU and vehicle arms. Most adverse reactions were mild in severity.



   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of luliconazole cream, 1%: contact dermatitis and cellulitis.

  6.1  Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In completed clinical trials, a total of 6307 adult subjects (128 healthy volunteers and 6179 patients) received Lumason at cumulative doses ranging from 0.2 to 161 mL (mean 10.5 mL). Lumason was administered mainly as single or multiple injections; however, some subjects received infusion dosing. The majority (73%) of subjects received Lumason at cumulative doses of 10 mL or less. There were 65% men and 35% women, with an average age of 59 years (range 17 to 99 years). A total of 4993 (79%) subjects were Caucasian; 192 (3%) were Black; 1053 (17%) were Asian; 33 (< 1%) were Hispanic; and 36 (<1%) were in other racial groups or race was not reported.



 In the clinical trials, serious adverse reactions were observed in 2 subjects; one who experienced a hypersensitivity-type rash and near syncope symptoms and another who experienced anaphylactic shock shortly following Lumason administration.



 The most commonly reported adverse reactions among patients (occurring among at least 0.2% of patients) are listed below (Table 1). Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved spontaneously.

        6.2  Postmarketing Experience
   In the international postmarketing clinical experience and on-going clinical trials, serious adverse reactions have uncommonly been reported following administration of Lumason. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The serious adverse reactions include fatalities, especially in a pattern of symptoms suggestive of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions. Other serious reactions included arrhythmias and hypertensive episodes. These reactions typically occurred within 30 minutes of Lumason administration.



 The risk for serious cardiopulmonary reactions may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions (acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary artery syndromes, worsening or unstable congestive heart failure, or serious ventricular arrhythmias  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ]  ).

   5.1  Cardiopulmonary Reactions



  Serious cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatalities have occurred uncommonly during or shortly following administration of ultrasound contrast agents, including Lumason. These reactions typically occurred within 30 minutes of administration. The risk for these reactions may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions (acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary artery syndromes, worsening or unstable congestive heart failure, or serious ventricular arrhythmias). Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to Lumason administration and monitor all patients for acute reactions.



 The reported reactions that may follow the administration of ultrasound contrast agents include: fatal cardiac or respiratory arrest, shock, syncope, symptomatic arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia), hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia, chest pain, respiratory distress, stridor, wheezing, loss of consciousness, and convulsions.



    5.2  Anaphylactoid Reactions



  Anaphylactoid reactions such as skin erythema, rash, urticaria, flushing, throat tightness, dyspnea, or anaphylactic shock have uncommonly been observed following the injection of Lumason. These reactions may occur in patients with no history of prior exposure to sulfur hexafluoride lipid containing microspheres.



    5.3  Systemic Embolization



  In patients with right-to-left, bi-directional, or transient right-to-left cardiac shunts, some intravenously injected sulfur hexafluoride lipid containing microspheres may bypass filtering by the lung and directly enter the arterial circulation. Occlusion of the microcirculation by these microspheres may result in tissue ischemia. Lumason is only for intravenous administration; do not administer Lumason by intra-arterial injection.



    5.4  High Mechanical Index



  High ultrasound mechanical index values may cause microsphere cavitation or rupture and lead to ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, end-systolic triggering with high mechanical indices has been reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias.

         The following adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities have been identified in >=10 to <20% of the 223 patients receiving Lynparza and not included in the table: cough, constipation, dysgeusia, peripheral edema, back pain, dizziness, headache, urinary tract infection, dyspnea, and rash. The following adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities have been identified in >=1 to <10% of the 223 patients receiving Lynparza and not included in the table: leukopenia, stomatitis, peripheral neuropathy, pyrexia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, dysuria, urinary incontinence, vulvovaginal disorder, dry skin/ eczema, pruritis, hypertension, venous thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism), and hot flush.
 

 Table 3 presents adverse reactions reported in >=20% of patients from a randomized trial of Lynparza 400 mg twice daily as maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous ovarian cancer following treatment with 2 or more platinum-containing regimens. Table 4 presents the laboratory abnormalities in patients from this randomized trial. Of the 96 patients with g  BRCA  -mutation, 53 received Lynparza, and 43 received placebo. The median duration on treatment with Lynparza was 11.1 months for patients with a g  BRCA  mutation compared to 4.4 months for patients with g  BRCA  mutation on placebo.



 Adverse reactions led to dose interruptions in 26% of those receiving Lynparza and 7% of those receiving placebo; dose reductions in 15% of Lynparza and 5% of placebo patients; and discontinuation in 9% of Lynparza and 0% in placebo patients. One (2%) patient on Lynparza died as a result of an adverse reaction.

LYNPARZA,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia: (MDS/AML) occurred in patients exposed to Lynparza, and some cases were fatal. Monitor patients for hematological toxicity at baseline and monthly thereafter. Discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Pneumonitis: occurred in patients exposed to Lynparza, and some cases were fatal. Interrupt treatment if pneumonitis is suspected. Discontinue if pneumonitis is confirmed. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Lynparza can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. (  5.3  ,  8.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia



  Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) have been confirmed in 6 out of 298 (2%) patients enrolled in a single arm trial of Lynparza monotherapy, in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA  -mutated ( gBRCA  m) advanced cancers. In a randomized placebo controlled trial, MDS/AML occurred in 3 out of 136 (2%) patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with Lynparza. Overall, MDS/AML were reported in 22 of 2,618 (<1%) patients treated with Lynparza. The majority of MDS/AML cases (17 of 22 cases) were fatal, and the duration of therapy with Lynparza in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer-therapy related AML varied from <6 months to >2 years. All patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents.



 Monitor complete blood count testing at baseline and monthly thereafter. Do not start Lynparza until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (<=CTCAE Grade 1). For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt Lynparza and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue Lynparza.



    5.2 Pneumonitis



  Pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred in <1% of patients treated with Lynparza. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, fever, cough, wheezing, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt treatment with Lynparza and initiate prompt investigation. If pneumonitis is confirmed, discontinue Lynparza.



    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Lynparza can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. Olaparib was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal toxicity in rats at exposures below those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 400 mg twice daily. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see     Use in Specific Populations (8.1)     ]  .



 Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant while taking Lynparza. If contraceptive methods are being considered, use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after receiving the last dose of Lynparza [see     Use in Specific Populations (8.6)     ]  .

EGRIFTA,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The most commonly reported adverse reactions are hypersensitivity (e.g., rash, urticaria) reactions due to the effect of GH (e.g., arthralgia, extremity pain, peripheral edema, hyperglycemia, carpal tunnel syndrome), injection site reactions (injection site erythema, pruritus, pain, urticaria, irritation, swelling, hemorrhage).



 During the first 26 weeks of treatment (main phase), discontinuations as a result of adverse reactions occurred in 9.6% of patients receiving EGRIFTA  (r)  and 6.8% of patients receiving placebo. Apart from patients with hypersensitivity reactions identified during the studies and who were discontinued per protocol (2.2%), the most common reasons for discontinuation of EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment were adverse reactions due to the effect of GH (4.2%) and local injection site reactions (4.6%).



 During the following 26 weeks of treatment (extension phase), discontinuations as a result of adverse events occurred in 2.4% of patients in the T-T group (patients treated with tesamorelin for Week 0-26 and with tesamorelin for Week 26-52) and 5.2% of patients in the T-P group (patients treated with tesamorelin for Week 0-26 and with placebo for Week 26-52).



   EXCERPT:   Most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5% and more frequent than placebo): Arthralgia, injection site erythema, injection site pruritus, pain in extremity, peripheral edema, and myalgia. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Seven hundred and forty HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy and excess abdominal fat were exposed to EGRIFTA  (r)  in the Phase 3 clinical trials; of these 543 received EGRIFTA  (r)  during the initial 26-week placebo-controlled phase  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )].  



 Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with EGRIFTA  (r)  relative to placebo and had an incidence >=1% during the first 26 weeks across all studies are presented in  Table 1  .

 In the EGRIFTA  (r)  Phase 3 clinical trials, mean baseline (Week 0) HbA1cwas 5.26% among patients in the EGRIFTA  (r)  group and 5.28% among those in the placebo group. At Week 26, mean HbA1cwas higher among patients treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  compared with placebo (5.39% vs. 5.28% for the EGRIFTA  (r)  and placebo groups, respectively, mean treatment difference of 0.12%, p=0.0004). Patients receiving EGRIFTA  (r)  had an increased risk of developing diabetes (HbA1clevel >= 6.5%) compared with placebo (4.5% vs. 1.3%), with a hazard ratio of 3.3 (CI 1.4, 9.6).

           6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins and peptides, there is a potential for in vivo development of anti- EGRIFTA  (r)  antibodies. In the combined Phase 3 clinical trials anti-tesamorelin IgG antibodies were detected in 49.5% of patients treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  for 26 weeks and 47.4% of patients who received EGRIFTA  (r)  for 52 weeks. In the subset of patients with hypersensitivity reactions, anti-tesamorelin IgG antibodies were detected in 85.2%. Cross-reactivity to endogenous growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) was observed in approximately 60% of patients who developed anti-tesamorelin antibodies. Patients with and without anti-tesamorelin IgG antibodies had similar mean reductions in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and IGF-1 response suggesting that the presence of antibodies did not alter the efficacy of EGRIFTA  (r)  . In a group of patients who had antibodies to tesamorelin after 26 weeks of treatment (56%) and were re-assessed 6 months later, after stopping EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment, 18% were still antibody positive.



 Neutralizing antibodies to tesamorelin and hGHRH were detected in vitro at Week 52 in 10% and 5% of EGRIFTA  (r)  -treated patients, respectively. They did not appear to have an impact on efficacy, as evidenced by comparable changes in VAT and IGF-1 level in patients with or without in vitro neutralizing antibodies.



 The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to EGRIFTA  (r)  with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

EGRIFTA,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Neoplasms: Preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to starting EGRIFTA  (r)  therapy. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Elevated IGF-1: Monitor regularly in all patients. Consider discontinuation in patients with persistent elevations. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Fluid retention: May include edema, arthralgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Glucose intolerance: May develop with EGRIFTA  (r)  use. Evaluate glucose status prior to and during therapy with EGRIFTA  (r)  . (  5.4  ) 
 *  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, urticaria): Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if suspected. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Injection site reactions: Advise patients to rotate sites. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Acute critical illness: Consider discontinuation. (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Neoplasms



  EGRIFTA  (r)  induces the release of endogenous growth hormone (GH), a known growth factor. Thus, patients with active malignancy should not be treated with EGRIFTA  (r)   [see Contraindications (  4.2  )]  .



 For patients with a history of non-malignant neoplasms, EGRIFTA  (r)  therapy should be initiated after careful evaluation of the potential benefit of treatment. For patients with a history of treated and stable malignancies, EGRIFTA  (r)  therapy should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the potential benefit of treatment relative to the risk of re-activation of the underlying malignancy.



 In addition, the decision to start treatment with EGRIFTA  (r)  should be considered carefully based on the increased background risk of malignancies in HIV-positive patients.



    5.2 Elevated IGF-1



  EGRIFTA  (r)  stimulates GH production and increases serum IGF-1. Given that IGF-1 is a growth factor and the effect of prolonged elevations in IGF-1 levels on the development or progression of malignancies is unknown, IGF-1 levels should be monitored closely during EGRIFTA  (r)  therapy. Careful consideration should be given to discontinuing EGRIFTA  (r)  in patients with persistent elevations of IGF-1 levels (e.g., >3 SDS), particularly if the efficacy response is not robust (e.g., based on visceral adipose tissue changes measured by waist circumference or CT scan).



 During the clinical trials, patients were monitored every three months. Among patients who received EGRIFTA  (r)  for 26 weeks, 47.4% had IGF-1 levels greater than 2 standard deviation scores (SDS), and 35.6% had SDS >3, with this effect seen as early as 13 weeks of treatment. Among those patients who remained on EGRIFTA  (r)  for a total of 52 weeks, at the end of treatment 33.7% had IGF-1 SDS >2 and 22.6% had IGF-1 SDS >3.



    5.3 Fluid Retention



  Fluid retention may occur during EGRIFTA  (r)  therapy and is thought to be related to the induction of GH secretion. It manifests as increased tissue turgor and musculoskeletal discomfort resulting in a variety of adverse reactions (e.g. edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome) which are either transient or resolve with discontinuation of treatment.



    5.4 Glucose Intolerance



  EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment may result in glucose intolerance. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, the percentages of patients with elevated HbA1c(>= 6.5%) from baseline to Week 26 were 4.5% and 1.3% in the EGRIFTA  (r)  and placebo groups, respectively. An increased risk of developing diabetes with EGRIFTA  (r)  (HbA1clevel >= 6.5%) relative to placebo was observed [intent-to-treat hazard odds ratio of 3.3 (CI 1.4, 9.6)]. Therefore, glucose status should be carefully evaluated prior to initiating EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment. In addition, all patients treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  should be monitored periodically for changes in glucose metabolism to diagnose those who develop impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. Diabetes is a known cardiovascular risk factor and patients who develop glucose intolerance have an elevated risk for developing diabetes. Caution should be exercised in treating HIV-positive patients with lipodystrophy with EGRIFTA  (r)  if they develop glucose intolerance or diabetes, and careful consideration should be given to discontinuing EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment in patients who do not show a clear efficacy response as judged by the degree of reduction in visceral adipose tissue by waist circumference or CT scan measurements.



 Since EGRIFTA  (r)  increases IGF-1, patients with diabetes who are receiving ongoing treatment with EGRIFTA  (r)  should be monitored at regular intervals for potential development or worsening of retinopathy.



    5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in patients treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  . Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 3.6% of patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  in the Phase 3 clinical trials. These reactions included pruritus, erythema, flushing, urticaria, and other rash. In cases of suspected hypersensitivity reactions, patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention and treatment with EGRIFTA  (r)  should be discontinued immediately.



    5.6 Injection Site Reactions



  EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment may cause injection site reactions, including injection site erythema, pruritus, pain, irritation, and bruising. The incidence of injection site reactions was 24.5% in EGRIFTA  (r)  -treated patients and 14.4% in placebo-treated patients during the first 26 weeks of treatment in the Phase 3 clinical trials. For patients who continued EGRIFTA  (r)  for an additional 26 weeks, the incidence of injection site reactions was 6.1%. In order to reduce the incidence of injection site reactions, it is recommended to rotate the site of injection to different areas of the abdomen.



    5.7 Acute Critical Illness



  Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of growth hormone. EGRIFTA  (r)  has not been studied in patients with acute critical illness. Since EGRIFTA  (r)  stimulates growth hormone production, careful consideration should be given to discontinuing EGRIFTA  (r)  in critically ill patients.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   ella  was studied in an open-label multicenter trial (Open-Label Study) and in a comparative, randomized, single-blind, multicenter trial (Single-Blind Comparative Study). In these studies, a total of 2,637 (1,533 + 1,104) women in the 30 mg ulipristal acetate groups were included in the safety analysis. The mean age of women who received ulipristal acetate was 24.5 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.3. The racial demographics of those enrolled were 67% Caucasian, 20% Black or African American, 2% Asian, and 12% other. 



 The most common adverse reactions (>= 10%) in the clinical trials for women receiving  ella  were headache (18% overall) and nausea (12% overall) and abdominal and upper abdominal pain (12% overall). Table 1 lists those adverse reactions that were reported in >= 5% of subjects in the clinical studies (  14  ).

ELLA,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   ella is not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy. Exclude pregnancy before administering. (  5.1)   
 *  Ectopic pregnancy: Women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking ella should be evaluated for ectopic pregnancy. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Effect on menstrual cycle: ella may alter the next expected menses. If menses is delayed beyond 1 week, pregnancy should be ruled out. (  5.5  ) 
 *   ella does not protect against STI/HIV. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Existing Pregnancy



   ella  is not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy. Pregnancy should be excluded before prescribing ella.  If pregnancy cannot be excluded on the basis of history and/or physical examination, pregnancy testing should be performed. A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or pregnancy status of any woman after taking ella  .



    5.2 Ectopic Pregnancy



  A history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to use of this emergency contraceptive method.  Healthcare providers, however, should consider the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking ella  .  A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or pregnancy status of any woman after taking ella  .



    5.3 Repeated Use



   ella  is for occasional use as an emergency contraceptive. It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of ella  within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.



    5.4 CYP3A4 Inducers



  A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, decreases the plasma concentration of ella significantly. Ella  should not be administered with CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug interactions (  7.1  ) and Pharmacokinetics (  12.3  )]  .



    5.5 Fertility Following Use



  A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with ella  for emergency contraception; therefore, routine contraception should be continued or initiated as soon as possible following use of ella  to ensure ongoing prevention of pregnancy. While there are no data about use of ella  with regular hormonal contraceptives, due to its high affinity binding to the progesterone receptor, use of ella  may reduce the contraceptive action of regular hormonal contraceptive methods. Therefore, after use of ella  , a reliable barrier method of contraception should be used with subsequent acts of intercourse that occur in that same menstrual cycle.



    5.6 Effect on Menstrual Cycle



  After ella  intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. Seven percent of subjects reported menses occurring more than 7 days earlier than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days. If there is a delay in the onset of expected menses beyond 1 week, rule out pregnancy.



 Nine percent of women studied reported intermenstrual bleeding after use of ella.  



    5.7 Sexually Transmitted Infections/HIV



   ella  does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice.



 The safety of ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI was evaluated in 1216 previously treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (Study 1) who were treated with ZALTRAP 4 mg per kg intravenous (N=611) or placebo (N=605) every two weeks (one cycle) in a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study. Patients received a median of 9 cycles of ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI or 8 cycles of placebo/FOLFIRI.



 The most common adverse reactions (all grades, >=20% incidence) reported at a higher incidence (2% or greater between-arm difference) in the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI arm , in order of decreasing frequency, were leukopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, proteinuria, AST increased, stomatitis, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ALT increased, hypertension, weight decreased, decreased appetite, epistaxis, abdominal pain, dysphonia, serum creatinine increased, and headache (see  Table 1  ).



 The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (>=5%) reported at a higher incidence (2% or greater between-arm difference) in the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI arm, in order of decreasing frequency, were neutropenia, diarrhea, hypertension, leukopenia, stomatitis, fatigue, proteinuria, and asthenia (see  Table 1  ).



 The most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in >=1% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen were asthenia/fatigue, infections, diarrhea, dehydration, hypertension, stomatitis, venous thromboembolic events, neutropenia, and proteinuria.



 The ZALTRAP dose was reduced and/or omitted in 17% of patients compared to placebo-dose modification in 5% of patients. Cycle delays >7 days occurred in 60% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared with 43% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI.



 The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities during study treatment in Study 1 where the incidence was >=5% (all grades) in patients receiving ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI and which occurred at >=2% higher frequency in patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to placebo/FOLFIRI are shown in Table 1.

 In patients with mCRC, severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI (0.3%) and placebo/FOLFIRI (0.5%).



 In patients with mCRC, venous thromboembolic events (VTE), consisting primarily of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, occurred in 9% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 7% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 VTE occurred in 8% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and in 6% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Pulmonary embolism occurred in 5% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 3.4% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In patients with various cancers across 15 studies, 1.4% (41/2862) of patients tested positive for anti-product antibody (APA) at baseline. The incidence of APA development was 3.1% (53/1687) in patients receiving intravenous ziv-aflibercept and 1.7% (19/1134) in patients receiving placebo. Among patients who tested positive for APA and had sufficient samples for further testing, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 17 of 48 ziv-aflibercept-treated patients and in 2 of 40 patients receiving placebo.



 The mean free ziv-aflibercept trough concentrations were lower in patients with positive neutralizing antibodies than in the overall population. The impact of neutralizing antibodies on efficacy and safety could not be assessed based on limited available data.



 Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ZALTRAP with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   5.1 Hemorrhage



  Patients treated with ZALTRAP have an increased risk of hemorrhage, including severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhagic events. In patients with mCRC, bleeding/hemorrhage (all grades) were reported in 38% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 hemorrhagic events, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and post-procedural hemorrhage, were reported in 3% of patients receiving ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared with 1% of patients receiving placebo/FOLFIRI. Severe intracranial hemorrhage and pulmonary hemorrhage/hemoptysis including fatal events have also occurred in patients receiving ZALTRAP.



 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Do not initiate ZALTRAP in patients with severe hemorrhage. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who develop severe hemorrhage [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].



    5.2 Gastrointestinal Perforation



  Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation including fatal GI perforation can occur in patients receiving ZALTRAP. Across three Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies (colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer populations), the incidence of GI perforation (all grades) was 0.8% for patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.3% for patients treated with placebo. Grade 3-4 GI perforation events occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.2% of patients treated with placebo.



 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of GI perforation. Discontinue ZALTRAP therapy in patients who experience GI perforation [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].



    5.3 Compromised Wound Healing



  ZALTRAP impairs wound healing in animal models [ see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)    ].



 Grade 3 compromised wound healing was reported in 2 patients (0.3%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and in none of the patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI regimen.



 Suspend ZALTRAP for at least 4 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not resume ZALTRAP for at least 4 weeks following major surgery and until the surgical wound is fully healed. For minor surgery such as central venous access port placement, biopsy, and tooth extraction, ZALTRAP may be initiated/resumed once the surgical wound is fully healed. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients with compromised wound healing [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].



    5.4 Fistula Formation



  Fistula formation involving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal sites occurs at a higher incidence in patients treated with ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, fistulas (anal, enterovesical, enterocutaneous, colovaginal, intestinal sites) were reported in 9 of 611 patients (1.5%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and 3 of 605 patients (0.5%) treated with placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3 GI fistula formation occurred in 2 patients treated with ZALTRAP (0.3%) and in 1 placebo-treated patient (0.2%).



 Discontinue ZALTRAP therapy in patients who develop fistula [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].



    5.5 Hypertension



  ZALTRAP increases the risk of Grade 3-4 hypertension. There is no clinical trial experience administering ZALTRAP to patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure. In patients with mCRC, Grade 3 hypertension (defined as requiring adjustment in existing anti-hypertensive therapy or treatment with more than one drug) was reported in 1.5% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI and 19% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) was reported in 1 patient (0.2%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. Among those patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI developing Grade 3-4 hypertension, 54% had onset during the first two cycles of treatment.



 Monitor blood pressure every two weeks or more frequently as clinically indicated during treatment with ZALTRAP. Treat with appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy and continue monitoring blood pressure regularly. Temporarily suspend ZALTRAP in patients with uncontrolled hypertension until controlled, and permanently reduce ZALTRAP dose to 2 mg per kg for subsequent cycles. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients with hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].



    5.6 Arterial Thromboembolic Events



  Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), including transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, and angina pectoris, occurred more frequently in patients who have received ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, ATE was reported in 2.6% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 1.7% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 events occurred in 11 patients (1.8%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 4 patients (0.7%) treated with placebo/FOLFIRI.



 Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who experience an ATE [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].



    5.7 Proteinuria



  Severe proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) occurred more frequently in patients treated with ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, proteinuria was reported in 62% patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 41% patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 proteinuria occurred in 8% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI to 1% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Nephrotic syndrome occurred in 2 patients (0.5%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to none of the patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. TMA was reported in 3 of 2258 patients with cancer enrolled across completed studies.



 Monitor proteinuria by urine dipstick analysis and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) for the development or worsening of proteinuria during ZALTRAP therapy. Patients with a dipstick of >=2+ for protein or a UPCR greater than 1 should undergo a 24-hour urine collection.



 Suspend ZALTRAP administration for proteinuria 2 grams per 24 hours or more, and resume when proteinuria is less than 2 grams per 24 hours. If recurrent, suspend until proteinuria is less than 2 grams per 24 hours and then permanently reduce the ZALTRAP dose to 2 mg per kg. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome or TMA [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].



    5.8 Neutropenia and Neutropenic Complications



  A higher incidence of neutropenic complications (febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection) occurred in patients receiving ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 37% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 30% patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 4% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 2% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 neutropenic infection/sepsis occurred in 1.5% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 1.2% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI.



 Monitor CBC with differential count at baseline and prior to initiation of each cycle of ZALTRAP. Delay ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI until neutrophil count is at or above 1.5 * 10  9  /L.



    5.9 Diarrhea and Dehydration



  The incidence of severe diarrhea is increased in patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. In patients with mCRC, Grade 3-4 diarrhea was reported in 19% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 8% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 dehydration was reported in 4% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 1% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. The incidence of diarrhea is increased in patients who are age 65 years or older as compared to patients younger than 65 years of age [ see  Geriatric Use (8.5)    ]. Monitor elderly patients closely for diarrhea.



    5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)



  RPLS (also known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) was reported in 0.5% of 3795 patients treated with ZALTRAP monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.



 Confirm the diagnosis of RPLS with MRI and discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who develop RPLS. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae or death [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 In three, 12 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy studies in patients with overactive bladder (Studies 1, 2, and 3), MYRBETRIQ  (r)  was evaluated for safety in 2736 patients  [see  Clinical Studies  (  14  )]  . Study 1 also included an active control. For the combined Studies 1, 2, and 3, 432 patients received MYRBETRIQ  (r)  25 mg, 1375 received MYRBETRIQ  (r)  50 mg, and 929 received MYRBETRIQ  (r)  100 mg once daily. In these studies, the majority of the patients were Caucasian (94%), and female (72%) with a mean age of 59 years (range 18 to 95 years).



 MYRBETRIQ  (r)  was also evaluated for safety in 1632 patients who received MYRBETRIQ  (r)  50 mg once daily (n=812 patients) or MYRBETRIQ  (r)  100 mg (n=820 patients) in a 1 year, randomized, fixed dose, double-blind, active controlled, safety study in patients with overactive bladder (Study 4). Of these patients, 731 received MYRBETRIQ  (r)  in a previous 12 week study. In Study 4, 1385 patients received MYRBETRIQ  (r)  continuously for at least 6 months, 1311 patients received MYRBETRIQ  (r)  for at least 9 months, and 564 patients received MYRBETRIQ  (r)  for at least 1 year.



 The most frequent adverse events (0.2%) leading to discontinuation in Studies 1, 2 and 3 for the 25 mg or 50 mg dose were nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness and tachycardia.



 Atrial fibrillation (0.2%) and prostate cancer (0.1%) were reported as serious adverse events by more than 1 patient and at a rate greater than placebo.



   Table 1  lists adverse reactions, derived from all adverse events, that were reported in Studies 1, 2 and 3 at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with MYRBETRIQ  (r)  25 mg or 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 2% of MYRBETRIQ  (r)  patients and greater than placebo) were hypertension, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection and headache.

         In Study 4, in patients treated with MYRBETRIQ  (r)  50 mg once daily, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by more than 2 patients and at a rate greater than active control included: constipation (0.9%), headache (0.6%), dizziness (0.5%), hypertension (0.5%), dry eyes (0.4%), nausea (0.4%), vision blurred (0.4%), and urinary tract infection (0.4%). Serious adverse events reported by at least 2 patients and exceeding active control included cerebrovascular accident (0.4%) and osteoarthritis (0.2%). Serum ALT/AST increased from baseline by greater than 10-fold in 2 patients (0.3%) taking MYRBETRIQ  (r)  50 mg, and these markers subsequently returned to baseline while both patients continued MYRBETRIQ  (r)  .
 

 In Study 4, serious adverse events of neoplasm were reported by 0.1%, 1.3%, and 0.5% of patients treated with MYRBETRIQ  (r)  50 mg, MYRBETRIQ  (r)  100 mg and active control once daily, respectively. Neoplasms reported by 2 patients treated with MYRBETRIQ  (r)  100 mg included breast cancer, lung neoplasm malignant and prostate cancer.



 In a separate clinical study in Japan, a single case was reported as Stevens-Johnson syndrome with increased serum ALT, AST and bilirubin in a patient taking MYRBETRIQ  (r)  100 mg as well as an herbal medication (Kyufu Gold).



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide postmarketing experience, from a population of uncertain size, the frequency of events and the role of mirabegron in their causation cannot be reliably determined.



 The following events have been reported in association with mirabegron use in worldwide postmarketing experience:



   Skin and subcutaneous tissue:  angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and larynx, with or without respiratory symptoms  [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.3  )]

MYRBETRIQ,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Increases in Blood Pressure: MYRBETRIQ  (r)  can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended, especially in hypertensive patients. MYRBETRIQ  (r)  is not recommended for use in severe uncontrolled hypertensive patients (  5.1  ). 
 *     Urinary Retention in Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction and in Patients Taking Antimuscarinic Drugs for Overactive Bladder: Administer with caution in these patients because of risk of urinary retention (  5.2  ). 
 *     Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with MYRBETRIQ  (r)  (  5.3  ,  6.2  ). 
 *     Patients Taking Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: MYRBETRIQ  (r)  is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Appropriate monitoring is recommended and dose adjustment may be necessary for narrow therapeutic index CYP2D6 substrates (  5.4  ,  7.1  ,  12.3  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Increases in Blood Pressure



  MYRBETRIQ  (r)  can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended, especially in hypertensive patients. MYRBETRIQ  (r)  is not recommended for use in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg) [see  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.2  )].  



 In two, randomized, placebo-controlled, healthy volunteer studies, MYRBETRIQ  (r)  was associated with dose-related increases in supine blood pressure. In these studies, at the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg, the mean maximum increase in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was approximately 3.5/1.5 mm Hg greater than placebo.



 In contrast, in OAB patients in clinical trials, the mean increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg was approximately 0.5 - 1 mm Hg greater than placebo. Worsening of pre-existing hypertension was reported infrequently in MYRBETRIQ  (r)  patients.



    5.2 Urinary Retention in Patients with Bladder Outlet Obstruction and in Patients Taking Antimuscarinic Medications for OAB



  Urinary retention in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and in patients taking antimuscarinic medications for the treatment of OAB has been reported in postmarketing experience in patients taking mirabegron. A controlled clinical safety study in patients with BOO did not demonstrate increased urinary retention in MYRBETRIQ  (r)  patients; however, MYRBETRIQ  (r)  should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant BOO. MYRBETRIQ  (r)  should also be administered with caution to patients taking antimuscarinic medications for the treatment of OAB [see  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.2  )].  



    5.3 Angioedema



   Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with MYRBETRIQ  (r)  . In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose. Cases of angioedema have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue MYRBETRIQ  (r)  and initiate appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )].    



    5.4 Patients Taking Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6



  Since mirabegron is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, the systemic exposure to CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol and desipramine is increased when co-administered with mirabegron. Therefore, appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary, especially with narrow therapeutic index drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, such as thioridazine, flecainide, and propafenone [see  Drug Interactions  (  7.1  ) and  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.3  )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience: Adults

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The safety assessment is based on the Week 96 pooled data from 1368 patients in the Phase 3 controlled trials TMC278-C209 (ECHO) and TMC278-C215 (THRIVE) in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult patients, 686 of whom received EDURANT (25 mg once daily)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . The median duration of exposure for patients in the EDURANT arm and efavirenz arm was 104.3 and 104.1 weeks, respectively. Most ADRs occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with EDURANT or efavirenz due to ADR, regardless of severity, was 2% and 4%, respectively. The most common ADRs leading to discontinuation were psychiatric disorders: 10 (1%) subjects in the EDURANT arm and 11 (2%) subjects in the efavirenz arm. Rash led to discontinuation in 1 (0.1%) subject in the EDURANT arm and 10 (1.5%) subjects in the efavirenz arm.



     Common Adverse Drug Reactions  



 ADRs of at least moderate intensity (>= Grade 2) reported in at least 2% of adult subjects are presented in Table 1. Selected treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities are included in Table 2.

              Adrenal Function  
 

 In the pooled Phase 3 trials, at Week 96, there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -0.69 (-1.12, 0.27) micrograms/dL in the EDURANT group and of -0.02 (-0.48, 0.44) micrograms/dL in the efavirenz group.



 In the EDURANT group, 43/588 (7.3%) of subjects with a normal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test at baseline developed an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test (peak cortisol level < 18.1 micrograms/dL) during the trial compared to 18/561 (3.2%) in the efavirenz group. Of the subjects who developed an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test during the trial, fourteen subjects in the EDURANT group and nine subjects in the efavirenz group had an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test at Week 96. Overall, there were no serious adverse events, deaths, or treatment discontinuations that could clearly be attributed to adrenal insufficiency. The clinical significance of the higher abnormal rate of 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation tests in the EDURANT group is not known.



     Serum Creatinine  



 In the pooled Phase 3 trials, an increase in serum creatinine was observed over the 96 weeks of treatment with EDURANT. Most of this increase occurred within the first four weeks of treatment, with a mean change of 0.1 mg/dL (range: -0.3 mg/dL to 0.6 mg/dL) observed after 96 weeks of treatment. In subjects who entered the trial with mild or moderate renal impairment, the serum creatinine increase observed was similar to that seen in subjects with normal renal function. These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant and no subject discontinued treatment due to increases in serum creatinine. Serum creatinine increases occurred regardless of the background N(t)RTI regimen.



     Serum Lipids  



 Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are presented in Table 3. The clinical benefit of these findings has not been demonstrated.

                   Subjects co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus  
 

 In subjects co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus receiving EDURANT, the incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation was higher than in subjects receiving EDURANT who were not co-infected. This observation was the same in the efavirenz arm. The pharmacokinetic exposure of rilpivirine in co-infected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without co-infection.



   6.2 Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatric Patients

  The safety assessment is based on the Week 48 analysis of the single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 trial, TMC278-C213, in which 36 antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected patients 12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 32 kg received EDURANT (25 mg once daily) in combination with other antiretroviral agents  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  . The median duration of exposure was 63.5 weeks. There were no patients who discontinued treatment due to ADRs. No new ADRs were identified compared to those seen in adults.



 ADRs were reported in nineteen pediatric subjects (52.8%). Most ADRs were Grade 1 or 2. The most common ADRs reported in at least 2 subjects (regardless of severity) include headache (19.4%), depression (19.4%), somnolence (13.9%), nausea (11.1%), dizziness (8.3%), abdominal pain (8.3), vomiting (5.6%) and rash (5.6%).



 Observed laboratory abnormalities were comparable to those in adults.



     Adrenal Function  



 In trial TMC278 C213, at Week 48, the overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol showed an increase of 1.59 (0.24, 2.93) micrograms/dL.



 Six of 30 (20%) subjects with a normal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test at baseline developed an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test (peak cortisol level < 18.1 micrograms/dL) during the trial. Three of these subjects had an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test at Week 48. Overall, there were no serious adverse events, deaths, or treatment discontinuations that could clearly be attributed to adrenal insufficiency. The clinical significance of the abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation tests is not known.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  Adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing experience in patients receiving a rilpivirine containing regimen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

EDURANT,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Caution should be given to prescribing EDURANT with drugs that may reduce the exposure of rilpivirine. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Caution should be given to prescribing EDURANT with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing experience, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), with rilpivirine-containing regimens. Immediately discontinue treatment if hypersensitivity or rash with systemic symptoms or elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries develop and closely monitor clinical status, including hepatic serum biochemistries. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Depressive Disorders: Severe depressive disorders have been reported. Immediate medical evaluation is recommended for severe depressive disorders. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients with underlying liver disease, including hepatitis B or C co-infection, or in patients with elevated baseline transaminases. A few cases of hepatotoxicity have occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease. Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment with EDURANT in patients with underlying hepatic disease, such as hepatitis B or C co-infection, or marked elevations in transaminase. Also consider monitoring liver functions tests in patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat (  5.5  ) or immune reconstitution syndrome. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Drug Interactions



  Caution should be given to prescribing EDURANT with drugs that may reduce the exposure of rilpivirine [see  Contraindications (4)  ,  Drug Interactions (7)  ,  and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .



 In healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram [see  Drug Interactions (7)    and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . EDURANT should be used with caution when co-administered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.



    5.2 Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions



   Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during the postmarketing experience, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), with rilpivirine-containing regimens. While some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunctions, including elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, treatment-related rashes with at least Grade 2 severity were reported in 3% of subjects receiving EDURANT. No grade 4 rash was reported. Overall, most rashes were Grade 1 or 2 and occurred in the first four to six weeks of therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6  and  6.2)  ]  . Discontinue EDURANT immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop, including but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, mucosal involvement, conjunctivitis, facial edema, angioedema, hepatitis or eosinophilia. Clinical status including laboratory parameters should be monitored and appropriate therapy should be initiated.  



    5.3 Depressive Disorders



   The adverse reaction depressive disorders (depressed mood, depression, dysphoria, major depression, mood altered, negative thoughts, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation) has been reported with EDURANT. Patients with severe depressive symptoms should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms are related to EDURANT, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits.  



  During the Phase 3 trials in adults (N = 1368) through 96 weeks, the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) reported among EDURANT (n = 686) or efavirenz (n = 682) was 9% and 8%, respectively. Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 1% for both EDURANT and efavirenz. The incidence of discontinuation due to depressive disorders among EDURANT or efavirenz was 1% in each arm. Suicidal ideation was reported in 4 subjects in each arm while suicide attempt was reported in 2 subjects in the EDURANT arm.  



  During the Phase 2 trial in pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age (N = 36) receiving EDURANT through 48 weeks, the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) was 19.4% (7/36). Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 5.6% (2/36). None of the subjects discontinued due to depressive disorders. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were reported in 1 subject.  



    5.4 Hepatotoxicity



  Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine containing regimen. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C, or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of EDURANT. A few cases of hepatic toxicity have been reported in adult patients receiving a rilpivirine containing regimen who had no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with EDURANT is recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C, or in patients with marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment initiation. Liver enzyme monitoring should also be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors.



    5.5 Fat Redistribution



  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and ""cushingoid appearance"" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.



    5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EDURANT. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety assessment of HARVONI was based on pooled data from three Phase 3 clinical trials of subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with compensated liver disease (with and without cirrhosis) including 215, 539, and 326 subjects who received HARVONI for 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  



 The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0%, <1%, and 1% for subjects receiving HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively.



 The most common adverse reactions (>=10%) were fatigue and headache in subjects treated with 8, 12, or 24 weeks of HARVONI.



 Table 2 lists adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator, all grades) observed in >=5% of subjects receiving 8, 12, or 24 weeks treatment with HARVONI in clinical trials. The majority of adverse reactions presented in Table 2 occurred at severity of grade 1. The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

     Bilirubin Elevations:  Bilirubin elevations of greater than 1.5*ULN were observed in 3%, <1%, and 2% of subjects treated with HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively.



     Lipase Elevations:  Transient, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3*ULN were observed in <1%, 2%, and 3% of subjects treated with HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively.



     Creatine Kinase:  Creatine kinase was not assessed in Phase 3 trials of HARVONI. Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations (Grade 3 or 4) have been previously reported in subjects treated with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon/ribavirin in other clinical trials.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of HARVONI. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

HARVONI,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Bradycardia with amiodarone coadministration: Serious symptomatic bradycardia may occur in patients taking amiodarone, particularly in patients also receiving beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease. Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI is not recommended. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. (  5.1  ,  6.2  ,  7.2  ) 
 *  Use with other drugs containing sofosbuvir, including SOVALDI, is not recommended (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone



   Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, as well as fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with HARVONI. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.  



  Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered HARVONI:  



 *   Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia  
 *   Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.  
     Patients who are taking HARVONI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  
 

  Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting HARVONI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  



  Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems [See  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .  



    5.2 Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to P-gp Inducers



  The concomitant use of HARVONI and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI. Therefore, the use of HARVONI with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



    5.3 Related Products Not Recommended



  The use of HARVONI with other products containing sofosbuvir (SOVALDI  (r)  ) is not recommended.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of OSPHENA has been assessed in nine phase 2/3 trials (N=1892) with doses ranging from 5 to 90 mg per day. The duration of treatment in these studies ranged from 6 weeks to 15 months. Most women (N=1370) had a treatment period of at least 12 weeks, 409 had at least 52 weeks (1 year) of exposure.



 The incidence rates of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic stroke were 0.72 per thousand women (1 reported case of thromboembolic stroke) and 1.45 per thousand women (2 reported cases of hemorrhagic stroke), respectively in OSPHENA 60 mg treatment group and 1.04 and 0 per thousand women, respectively in placebo. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was 1.45 per thousand women in OSPHENA 60 mg treatment group (2 reported cases of DVT) and 1.04 (1 case of DVT) in placebo.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ENDOMETRIAL CANCER AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS

    WARNING: ENDOMETRIAL CANCER AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS  

    Endometrial Cancer  



   OSPHENA is an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue selective effects.  In the endometrium, OSPHENA has estrogen agonistic effects. There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed and random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].    



   Cardiovascular Disorders  



   There is a reported increased risk of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) who received daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625 mg]-alone therapy over 7.1 years as part of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].    



   In the clinical trials for OSPHENA (duration of treatment up to 15 months), the incidence rates of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic stroke were 0.72 and 1.45 per thousand women, respectively in OSPHENA 60 mg treatment group and 1.04 and 0 in placebo   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  . The incidence of DVT was 1.45 per thousand women in OSPHENA 60 mg treatment group and 1.04 per thousand women in placebo   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  . OSPHENA should be prescribed for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

   EXCERPT:    *  Venous Thromboembolism: Risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism (  5.1  ) 
 *  Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer (  5.2  ) 
 *  Severe Hepatic Impairment (  5.3  ,  8.7  ,  12.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cardiovascular Disorders



  Risk factors for cardiovascular disorders, arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus), should be managed appropriately.



    Stroke  



 In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per ten thousand women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted.



 In the clinical trials for OSPHENA (duration of treatment up to 15 months), the incidence rates of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic stroke were 0.72 and 1.45 per thousand women, respectively in OSPHENA 60 mg treatment group and 1.04 and 0 per thousand women in placebo.



 Should thromboembolic or hemorrhagic stroke occur or be suspected, OSPHENA should be discontinued immediately.



    Coronary Heart Disease  



 In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo. In the OSPHENA clinical trials, a single MI occurred in a woman receiving 60 mg of ospemifene.



    Venous Thromboembolism  



 In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE), was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per ten thousand women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per ten thousand women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years.



 In the OSPHENA clinical trials, the incidence of DVT was 1.45 per thousand women in OSPHENA 60 mg treatment group and 1.04 per thousand women in placebo. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, OSPHENA should be discontinued immediately.



 If feasible, OSPHENA should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.



    5.2 Malignant Neoplasms



   Endometrial Cancer  



 OSPHENA is an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue selective effects. In the endometrium, OSPHENA has agonistic effects. In the OSPHENA clinical trials (60 mg treatment group), no cases of endometrial cancer were seen with exposure up to 52 weeks. There was a single case of simple hyperplasia without atypia. Endometrial thickening equal to 5 mm or greater was seen in the OSPHENA treatment groups at a rate of 60.1 per thousand women vs. 21.2 per thousand women for placebo. The incidence of any type of proliferative (weakly plus active plus disordered) endometrium was 86.1 per thousand women in OSPHENA vs. 13.3 per thousand women for placebo. Uterine polyps occurred at an incidence of 5.9 per thousand women vs. 1.8 per thousand women for placebo.



 An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Adding a progestin to postmenopausal estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. The use of progestins with OSPHENA therapy was not evaluated in the clinical trials.



 Clinical surveillance of all women using OSPHENA is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.



    Breast Cancer  



 OSPHENA 60 mg has not been adequately studied in women with breast cancer; therefore, it should not be used in women with known or suspected breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer.



    5.3 Severe Hepatic Impairment



  OSPHENA should not be used in women with severe hepatic impairment [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].

   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, ERIVEDGE can cause embryo-fetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, vismodegib was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic at maternal exposures lower than the human exposures at the recommended dose of 150 mg/day.



 Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating ERIVEDGE therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with ERIVEDGE and for 7 months after the final dose. Advise male patients to use condoms, even after a vasectomy, to avoid potential drug exposure in pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive potential during therapy and for 3 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [see   Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)     and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)    ].



    5.2 Blood Donation



  Advise patients not to donate blood or blood products while receiving ERIVEDGE and for 7 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE.



    5.3 Semen Donation



  Vismodegib is present in semen. It is not known if the amount of vismodegib in semen can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise male patients not to donate semen during and for 3 months after the final dose of ERIVEDGE [see   Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)    ] .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The information below is derived from an integrated clinical study database for LATUDA consisting of 3799 patients exposed to one or more doses of LATUDA for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression in placebo-controlled studies. This experience corresponds with a total experience of 1250.9 patient-years. A total of 1106 LATUDA-treated patients had at least 24 weeks and 371 LATUDA-treated patients had at least 52 weeks of exposure.



 Adverse events during exposure to study treatment were obtained by general inquiry and voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results from physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, weights and laboratory investigations. Adverse experiences were recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. In order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology.



     Schizophrenia  



 The following findings are based on the short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for schizophrenia in which LATUDA was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 160 mg (n=1508).



     Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:  The most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with LATUDA were somnolence, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and nausea.



     Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment:  A total of 9.5% (143/1508) LATUDA-treated patients and 9.3% (66/708) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with LATUDA that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.



     Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in LATUDA-Treated Patients:  Adverse reactions associated with the use of LATUDA (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and LATUDA incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with schizophrenia) are shown in  Table 15  .

                  Dose-Related Adverse Reactions in the Schizophrenia Studies  
 

 Akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms were dose-related. The frequency of akathisia increased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for LATUDA 20 mg, 10.7% for LATUDA 40 mg, 12.3% for LATUDA 80 mg, and 22.0% for LATUDA 120 mg). Akathisia was reported by 7.4% (9/121) of patients receiving 160 mg/day. Akathisia occurred in 3.0% of subjects receiving placebo. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms increased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for LATUDA 20 mg, 11.5% for LATUDA 40 mg, 11.9% for LATUDA 80 mg, and 22.0% for LATUDA 120 mg).



     Bipolar Depression (Monotherapy)  



 The following findings are based on the short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing study for bipolar depression in which LATUDA was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg (n=331).



     Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:  The most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5%, in either dose group, and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with LATUDA were akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anxiety.



     Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment:  A total of 6.0% (20/331) LATUDA-treated patients and 5.4% (9/168) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with LATUDA that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.



     Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in LATUDA-Treated Patients:  Adverse reactions associated with the use of LATUDA (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and LATUDA incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with bipolar depression) are shown in  Table 16  .

                 Dose-Related Adverse Reactions in the Monotherapy Study:  
 

 In the short-term, placebo-controlled study (involving lower and higher LATUDA dose ranges) [see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )] the adverse reactions that occurred with a greater than 5% incidence in the patients treated with LATUDA in any dose group and greater than placebo in both groups were nausea (10.4%, 17.4%), somnolence (7.3%, 13.8%), akathisia (7.9%, 10.8%), and extrapyramidal symptoms (4.9%, 9.0%) for LATUDA 20 to 60 mg/day and LATUDA 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively.



     Bipolar Depression  



     Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 The following findings are based on two short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for bipolar depression in which LATUDA was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (n=360).



     Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:  The most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in subjects treated with LATUDA were akathisia and somnolence.



     Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment:  A total of 5.8% (21/360) LATUDA-treated patients and 4.8% (16/334) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with LATUDA that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.

         In the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia and bipolar depression studies, data was objectively collected on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (SAS) for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) for akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesias.
 

     Schizophrenia  



 The mean change from baseline for LATUDA-treated patients for the SAS, BAS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients, with the exception of the Barnes Akathisia Scale global score (LATUDA, 0.1; placebo, 0.0). The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in LATUDA-treated patients versus placebo for the BAS (LATUDA, 14.4%; placebo, 7.1%), the SAS (LATUDA, 5.0%; placebo, 2.3%) and the AIMS (LATUDA, 7.4%; placebo, 5.8%).



     Bipolar Depression  



     Monotherapy  



 The mean change from baseline for LATUDA-treated patients for the SAS, BAS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in LATUDA-treated patients versus placebo for the BAS (LATUDA, 8.4%; placebo, 5.6%), the SAS (LATUDA, 3.7%; placebo, 1.9%) and the AIMS (LATUDA, 3.4%; placebo, 1.2%).



   Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 The mean change from baseline for LATUDA-treated patients for the SAS, BAS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in LATUDA-treated patients versus placebo for the BAS (LATUDA, 8.7%; placebo, 2.1%), the SAS (LATUDA, 2.8%; placebo, 2.1%) and the AIMS (LATUDA, 2.8%; placebo, 0.6%).



     Dystonia  



     Class Effect:  Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.



     Schizophrenia  



 In the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia clinical studies, dystonia occurred in 4.2% of LATUDA-treated subjects (0.0% LATUDA 20 mg, 3.5% LATUDA 40 mg, 4.5% LATUDA 80 mg, 6.5% LATUDA 120 mg and 2.5% LATUDA 160 mg) compared to 0.8% of subjects receiving placebo. Seven subjects (0.5%, 7/1508) discontinued clinical trials due to dystonic events - four were receiving LATUDA 80 mg/day and three were receiving LATUDA 120 mg/day.



     Bipolar Depression  



     Monotherapy  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, dystonia occurred in 0.9% of LATUDA-treated subjects (0.0% and 1.8% for LATUDA 20 to 60 mg/day and LATUDA 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively) compared to 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo. No subject discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events.



     Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, dystonia occurred in 1.1% of LATUDA-treated subjects (20 to 120 mg) compared to 0.6% of subjects receiving placebo. No subject discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events.



     Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of LATUDA  



 Following is a list of adverse reactions reported by patients treated with LATUDA at multiple doses of >= 20 mg once daily within the premarketing database of 2905 patients with schizophrenia. The reactions listed are those that could be of clinical importance, as well as reactions that are plausibly drug-related on pharmacologic or other grounds. Reactions listed in  Table 15  or those that appear elsewhere in the LATUDA label are not included. Although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with LATUDA, they were not necessarily caused by it.



 Reactions are further categorized by organ class and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (frequent) (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients (infrequent); and those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients (rare).

  WARNINGS: INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS; AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS



    *  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. 
 *  LATUDA is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )].

   5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis



  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6- to 1.7-times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. LATUDA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see  Boxed Warning  ]  .



    5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults



  Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.



 Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.



 The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk of differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in  Table 2  .

                                                    Decreases Compared to Placebo

 >=65                                               6 fewer cases                                        
        No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.
 

 It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.



  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  



 The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.



 Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.



  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for LATUDA should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.  



    5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis



  In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. LATUDA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see also Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )].  



    5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome



  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including LATUDA.



 Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.



 The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.



 The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.



 If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. If reintroduced, the patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.



    5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia



  Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements that can develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.



 The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.



 There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.



 Given these considerations, LATUDA should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.



 If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on LATUDA, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with LATUDA despite the presence of the syndrome.



    5.6 Metabolic Changes



  Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.



    Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus  



 Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Because LATUDA was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if LATUDA is associated with this increased risk.



 Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

         In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who received LATUDA, as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate in the short-term study and continued in the longer-term study, had a mean change in total cholesterol and triglycerides of -0.9 (n=88) and +5.3 (n=88) mg/dL at week 24, respectively.
 

    Weight Gain  



 Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.



    Schizophrenia  



 Pooled data from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies are presented in  Table 9  . The mean weight gain was +0.43 kg for LATUDA-treated patients compared to -0.02 kg for placebo-treated patients. Change in weight from baseline for olanzapine was +4.15 kg and for quetiapine extended-release was +2.09 kg in Studies 3 and 5 [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  , respectively. The proportion of patients with a >= 7% increase in body weight (at Endpoint) was 4.8% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 3.3% for placebo-treated patients.

             In the uncontrolled, longer-term schizophrenia studies (primarily open-label extension studies), LATUDA was associated with a mean change in weight of -0.69 kg at week 24 (n=755), -0.59 kg at week 36 (n=443) and -0.73 kg at week 52 (n=377).
 

    Bipolar Depression  



    Monotherapy  



 Data from the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study are presented in  Table 10  . The mean weight gain was +0.29 kg for LATUDA-treated patients compared to -0.04 kg for placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients with a >= 7% increase in body weight (at Endpoint) was 2.4% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 0.7% for placebo-treated patients.

         In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who were treated with LATUDA, as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a mean change in weight of +1.28 kg at week 24 (n=86).
 

    5.7 Hyperprolactinemia



  As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, LATUDA elevates prolactin levels.



 Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .



 Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in a LATUDA carcinogenicity study conducted in rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13  )].  Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.



  Schizophrenia  



 In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels for LATUDA-treated patients was +0.4 ng/mL and was -1.9 ng/mL in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +0.5 ng/mL and for females was -0.2 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin by dose are shown in  Table 12  .

             The proportion of patients with prolactin elevations >= 5* upper limit of normal (ULN) was 2.8% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 1.0% for placebo-treated patients. The proportion of female patients with prolactin elevations >= 5x ULN was 5.7% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 2.0% for placebo-treated female patients. The proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations >= 5x ULN was 1.6% versus 0.6% for placebo-treated male patients.
 

 In the uncontrolled longer-term schizophrenia studies (primarily open-label extension studies), LATUDA was associated with a median change in prolactin of -0.9 ng/mL at week 24 (n=357), -5.3ng/mL at week 36 (n=190) and -2.2 ng/mL at week 52 (n=307).



    Bipolar Depression  



    Monotherapy  



 The median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels, in the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, was +1.7 ng/mL and +3.5 ng/mL with LATUDA 20 to 60 mg/day and 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively compared to +0.3 ng/mL with placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +1.5 ng/mL and for females was +3.1 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin by dose range are shown in  Table 13  .

The proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations >= 5x ULN was 0% versus 0% for placebo-treated male patients.
 

 In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who were treated with LATUDA as monotherapy in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a median change in prolactin of -1.15 ng/mL at week 24 (n=130).



  Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 The median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels, in the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies was +2.8 ng/mL with LATUDA 20 to 120 mg/day compared to 0.0 ng/mL with placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +2.4 ng/mL and for females was +3.2 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin across the dose range are shown in  Table 14  .

 In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who were treated with LATUDA, as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate, in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a median change in prolactin of -2.9 ng/mL at week 24 (n=88).



    5.8 Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis



  Leukopenia/neutropenia has been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.



 Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and LATUDA should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in WBC, in the absence of other causative factors.



 Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm  3  ) should discontinue LATUDA and have their WBC followed until recovery.



    5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope



  LATUDA may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, perhaps due to its alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-naive. In such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.



 Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: >= 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and >= 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position.



    Schizophrenia  



 The incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was (LATUDA incidence, placebo incidence): orthostatic hypotension [0.3% (5/1508), 0.1% (1/708)] and syncope [0.1% (2/1508), 0% (0/708)].



 In short-term schizophrenia clinical studies, orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.8% with LATUDA 40 mg, 2.1% with LATUDA 80 mg, 1.7% with LATUDA 120 mg and 0.8% with LATUDA 160 mg compared to 0.7% with placebo.



    Bipolar Depression  



    Monotherapy  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope.



 Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.6% with LATUDA 20 to 60 mg and 0.6% with LATUDA 80 to 120 mg compared to 0% with placebo.



  Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression therapy studies, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 1.1% with LATUDA 20 to 120 mg compared to 0.9% with placebo.



    5.10 Seizures



  As with other antipsychotic drugs, LATUDA should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer's dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.



  Schizophrenia  



 In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (2/1508) of patients treated with LATUDA compared to 0.1% (1/708) placebo-treated patients.



    Bipolar Depression  



    Monotherapy  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions.



    Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions.



    5.11 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment



  LATUDA, like other antipsychotics, has the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with LATUDA does not affect them adversely.



 In clinical studies with LATUDA, somnolence included: hypersomnia, hypersomnolence, sedation and somnolence.



    Schizophrenia  



 In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, somnolence was reported by 17.0% (256/1508) of patients treated with LATUDA (15.5% LATUDA 20 mg, 15.6% LATUDA 40 mg, 15.2% LATUDA 80 mg, 26.5% LATUDA 120 mg and 8.3% LATUDA 160 mg/day) compared to 7.1% (50/708) of placebo patients.



    Bipolar Depression  



    Monotherapy  



 In the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, somnolence was reported by 7.3% (12/164) and 13.8% (23/167) with LATUDA 20 to 60 mg and 80 to120 mg, respectively compared to 6.5% (11/168) of placebo patients.



    Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 In the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, somnolence was reported by 11.4% (41/360) of patients treated with LATUDA 20-120 mg compared to 5.1% (17/334) of placebo patients.



    5.12 Body Temperature Dysregulation



  Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing LATUDA for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.9  )].  



    5.13 Suicide



  The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illness and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for LATUDA should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.



    Schizophrenia  



 In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 0.4% (6/1508) for LATUDA-treated patients compared to 0.8% (6/708) on placebo. No suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in these studies.



    Bipolar Depression  



    Monotherapy  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 0.0% (0/331) with LATUDA-treated patients compared to 0.0% (0/168) with placebo-treated patients. No suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in this study.



    Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 1.1% (4/360) for LATUDA-treated patients compared to 0.3% (1/334) on placebo. No suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in these studies.



    5.14 Activation of Mania/Hypomania



  Antidepressant treatment can increase the risk of developing a manic or hypomanic episode, particularly in patients with bipolar disorder. Monitor patients for the emergence of such episodes.



 In the bipolar depression monotherapy and adjunctive therapy (with lithium or valproate) studies, less than 1% of subjects in the LATUDA and placebo groups developed manic or hypomanic episodes.



    5.15 Dysphagia



  Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. LATUDA and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.



    5.16 Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies



  Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinical features consistent with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 During clinical development, 1,651 subjects were exposed to Lexiscan, with most receiving 0.4 mg as a rapid (<= 10 seconds) intravenous injection. Most of these subjects received Lexiscan in two clinical studies that enrolled patients who had no history of bronchospastic lung disease as well as no history of a cardiac conduction block of greater than first-degree AV block, except for patients with functioning artificial pacemakers. In these studies (Studies 1 and 2), 2,015 patients underwent myocardial perfusion imaging after administration of Lexiscan (N = 1,337) or Adenoscan  (r)  (N = 678). The population was 26-93 years of age (median 66 years), 70% male and primarily Caucasian (76% Caucasian, 7% African American, 9% Hispanic, 5% Asian).  Table 1  shows the most frequently reported adverse reactions.



 Overall, any adverse reaction occurred at similar rates between the study groups (80% for the Lexiscan group and 83% for the Adenoscan group). Aminophylline was used to treat the reactions in 3% of patients in the Lexiscan group and 2% of patients in the Adenoscan group. Most adverse reactions began soon after dosing, and generally resolved within approximately 15 minutes, except for headache which resolved in most patients within 30 minutes.

 In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 3) of 999 subjects with asthma (n=532) or stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=467), the overall incidence of pre-specified respiratory adverse reactions was greater in the Lexiscan group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001). Most respiratory adverse reactions resolved without therapy; a few subjects received aminophylline or a short acting bronchodilator. No differences were observed between treatment arms in the reduction of >15% from baseline at two-hours in FEV1(  Table 3  ).

 In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 504 subjects (Lexiscan n=334 and placebo n=170) with a diagnosis or risk factors for coronary artery disease and NKFK/DOQI Stage III or IV renal impairment (defined as GFR 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ), no serious adverse events were reported through the 24-hour follow-up period.



   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

    Cardiovascular  



 Myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (new-onset or recurrent), atrial flutter, heart block (including third-degree block), asystole, marked hypertension, symptomatic hypotension in association with transient ischemic attack, seizures and syncope [  see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.1  ), (  5.2  ), (  5.3  ), (  5.5  ), (  5.6  ) and (  5.8  )  ] have been reported. Some events required intervention with fluids and/or aminophylline [  see  Overdosage  (  10  )  ]. QTc prolongation shortly after Lexiscan administration has been reported.



   Central Nervous System  



 Tremor, seizure, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident including intracranial hemorrhage [  see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.8  ) and (  5.9  )  ].



   Gastrointestinal  



 Abdominal pain, occasionally severe, has been reported a few minutes after Lexiscan administration, in association with nausea, vomiting, or myalgias; administration of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, appeared to lessen the pain. Diarrhea and fecal incontinence have also been reported following Lexiscan administration.



   Hypersensitivity  



 Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria, rashes have occurred and have required treatment including resuscitation [  see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.4  )  ].



   Musculoskeletal  



 Musculoskeletal pain has occurred, typically 10-20 minutes after Lexiscan administration; the pain was occasionally severe, localized in the arms and lower back and extended to the buttocks and lower legs bilaterally. Administration of aminophylline appeared to lessen the pain.



   Respiratory  



 Respiratory arrest, dyspnea and wheezing have been reported following Lexiscan administration.



 Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Lexiscan exposure.

   EXCERPT:    *    Myocardial Ischemia. Fatal cardiac events have occurred. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example unstable angina or cardiovascular instability, who may be at greater risk. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administration (  5.1  ) 
 *    Sinoatrial (SA) and Atrioventricular (AV) Nodal Block. Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia (  5.2  ) 
 *    Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter. New-onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter have been reported (  5.3  ) 
 *    Hypersensitivity, including Anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria, and rashes have occurred. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available (  5.4  ) 
 *    Hypotension. Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, induce vasodilation and hypotension. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency, or hypovolemia (  5.5  ) 
 *    Hypertension. Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may induce clinically significant increases in blood pressure particularly in patients with a history of hypertension and when the MPI includes low level exercise (  5.6  ) 
 *    Bronchoconstriction. Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may induce dyspnea, bronchoconstriction and respiratory compromise in patients with COPD or asthma. Resuscitative measures should be available (  5.7  ) 
 *    Seizure. Lexiscan may lower the seizure threshold. New onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred. Some seizures are prolonged and require urgent anticonvulsive management. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience a seizure in association with Lexiscan (  5.8  ) 
 *    Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke). Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred (  5.9  ) 
    
 

    5.1 Myocardial Ischemia  



   Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest have occurred following Lexiscan injection. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to Lexiscan. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administering Lexiscan. If serious reactions to Lexiscan occur, consider the use of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, to shorten the duration of increased coronary blood flow induced by Lexiscan [ see  Overdosage  (  10  )  ].  



    5.2 Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular Nodal Block



  Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia requiring intervention. In clinical trials first-degree AV block (PR prolongation > 220 msec) developed in 3% of patients within 2 hours of Lexiscan administration; transient second-degree AV block with one dropped beat was observed in one patient receiving Lexiscan. In post-marketing experience, third-degree heart block and asystole within minutes of Lexiscan administration have occurred [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )  ].



     5.3 Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter  



   New-onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter have been reported following Lexiscan injection [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )  ].  



    5.4 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis



  Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria and rashes have occurred. In clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in fewer than 1 percent of patients [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  )  ]. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available.



    5.5 Hypotension



  Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. In clinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 35 mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and decreased diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was observed in 4% of patients within 45 min of Lexiscan administration. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. In post-marketing experience, syncope, transient ischemic attacks and seizures have been observed [ see  Adverse Reactions   (  6.2  )  ].



    5.6 Hypertension



  Administration of adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may result in clinically significant increases in blood pressure in some patients. Among patients who experienced an increase in blood pressure in clinical trials, the increase was observed within minutes of Lexiscan administration. Most increases resolved within 10 to 15 minutes, but in some cases, increases were observed at 45 minutes following administration [ see  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.2  )  ]. In post-marketing experience, cases of potentially clinically significant hypertension have been reported, particularly with underlying hypertension and when low-level exercise was included in the MPI [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )  ].



    5.7 Bronchoconstriction



  Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may cause dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise. Appropriate bronchodilator therapy and resuscitative measures should be available prior to Lexiscan administration [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ),  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.2  ),  Overdosage  (  10  ) and  Patient Counseling Information  (  17  )  ].



     5.8 Seizure  



   Lexiscan may lower the seizure threshold. New-onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred following Lexiscan injection. Some seizures are prolonged and require emergent anticonvulsive management. Aminophylline may increase the risk of seizures associated with Lexiscan injection. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience a seizure in association with Lexiscan administration.  



     5.9 Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke)  



   Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred. Hemodynamic effects of Lexiscan including hypotension or hypertension may be associated with these adverse reactions [ see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.5  ) and (  5.6  )  ].

  PLATO Minor bleed: requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding.  PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units.  PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units.  Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days.    
         No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with BRILINTA compared to clopidogrel.
 

 In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2.



   Figure 2 - 'Major fatal/life-threatening' CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO)  



 X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG.



 The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other haemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

   Other Adverse Reactions in PEGASUS  



 Adverse reactions that occurred in PEGASUS at rates of 3% or more are shown in Table 5.



 Table 5 - Non-hemorrhagic adverse reactions reported in >3.0% of patients in the ticagrelor 60 mg treatment group (PEGASUS)

  Diarrhea     3.3             2.5             
           Bradycardia  
 

 In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with BRILINTA (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6% respectively after 1 month. PLATO and PEGASUS excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2  nd  or 3  rd  degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). In PLATO, syncope, pre-syncope and loss of consciousness were reported by 1.7% and 1.5% of BRILINTA 90 mg and clopidogrel patients, respectively. In PEGASUS, syncope was reported by 1.2% and 0.9% of patients on BRILINTA 60 mg and aspirin alone, respectively.



     Lab abnormalities    



 Serum Uric Acid:



 In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on BRILINTA 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group).



 In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on BRILINTA 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on BRILINTA than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%,1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped.



 Serum Creatinine:



 In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving BRILINTA 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria.



 In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving BRILINTA 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function.

  WARNING:  (A) BLEEDING RISK, (B) ASPIRIN DOSE AND BRILINTA EFFECTIVENESS

    A.  BLEEDING RISK  



 *  BRILINTA, like other antiplatelet agents, can cause significant, sometimes fatal bleeding (5.1, 6.1). 
 *  Do not use BRILINTA in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of intracranial hemorrhage (4.1, 4.2). 
 *  Do not start BRILINTA in patients undergoing urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (5.1, 6.1). 
 *  If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing BRILINTA. Stopping BRILINTA increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events (5.4). 
      B.  ASPIRIN DOSE AND BRILINTA EFFECTIVENESS  
 

 *  Maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg reduce the effectiveness of BRILINTA and should be avoided (2.1, 5.2, 14.1).

   EXCERPT:    *    Dyspnea was reported more frequently with BRILINTA than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea resulting from BRILINTA is self-limiting.  (5.3)   
 *    Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor.  (5.5)   
    
 

    5.1 General Risk of Bleeding  



   Drugs that inhibit platelet function including BRILINTA increase the risk of bleeding [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].  



  If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing BRILINTA. Stopping BRILINTA increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events [ see        Warnings and Precautions (5.4)        and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].  



    5.2 Concomitant Aspirin Maintenance Dose



  In PLATO the use of BRILINTA with maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg decreased the effectiveness of BRILINTA. Therefore, after the initial loading dose of aspirin, use BRILINTA with a maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg [ see     Dosage and Administration (2.1)     and     Clinical Studies (14.1)    ] .  



     5.3 Dyspnea  



   In clinical trials, about 14% of patients treated with BRILINTA developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment, but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% of BRILINTA and 0.1% of clopidogrel patients in PLATO and 4.3% of BRILINTA 60 mg and 0.7% on aspirin alone patients in PEGASUS.  



  In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment.  



  If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to BRILINTA, no specific treatment is required; continue BRILINTA without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of BRILINTA, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent.  



     5.4 Discontinuation of BRILINTA  



   Discontinuation of BRILINTA will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. If BRILINTA must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with BRILINTA for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume BRILINTA as soon as hemostasis is achieved.  



     5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment  



   Avoid use of BRILINTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of BRILINTA patients with severe hepatic impairment [see   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)    ].

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice.



 This section describes adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from analyses of Trial 1 and Trial 2  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . Trial 1 randomized (1:1) 675 treatment-naive patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma to receive ZELBORAF 960 mg orally twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  2  intravenously every 3 weeks. In Trial 2, 132 patients with metastatic melanoma and failure of at least one prior systemic therapy received treatment with ZELBORAF 960 mg orally twice daily.



   Table 1  presents adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of patients treated with ZELBORAF. The most common adverse reactions of any grade (>= 30% in either study) in ZELBORAF-treated patients were arthralgia, rash, alopecia, fatigue, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, pruritus, and skin papilloma. The most common (>= 5%) Grade 3 adverse reactions were cuSCC and rash. The incidence of Grade 4 adverse reactions was <= 4% in both studies.



 The incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication in Trial 1 was 7% for the ZELBORAF arm and 4% for the dacarbazine arm. In Trial 2, the incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication was 3% in ZELBORAF-treated patients. The median duration of study treatment was 4.2 months for ZELBORAF and 0.8 months for dacarbazine in Trial 1, and 5.7 months for ZELBORAF in Trial 2.

   5.1 New Primary Malignancies



   Cutaneous Malignancies  



 Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, and melanoma occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to those in the control arm in Trial 1. The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCC) and keratoacanthomas in the ZELBORAF arm was 24% compared to < 1% in the dacarbazine arm [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The median time to the first appearance of cuSCC was 7 to 8 weeks; approximately 33% of patients who developed a cuSCC while receiving ZELBORAF experienced at least one additional occurrence with median time between occurrences of 6 weeks. Potential risk factors associated with cuSCC observed in clinical studies using ZELBORAF included age (>= 65 years), prior skin cancer, and chronic sun exposure.



 In Trial 1, new primary malignant melanoma occurred in 2.1% (7/336) of patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to none of the patients receiving dacarbazine.



 Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of therapy and every 2 months while on therapy. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Consider dermatologic monitoring for 6 months following discontinuation of ZELBORAF.



    Non-Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma  



 Non-cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the head and neck can occur in patients receiving ZELBORAF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor patients receiving ZELBORAF closely for signs or symptoms of new non-cutaneous SCC.



    Other Malignancies  



 Based on mechanism of action, ZELBORAF may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  . Monitor patients receiving ZELBORAF closely for signs or symptoms of other malignancies.



    5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Melanoma



  In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells that are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of ZELBORAF [see  Indications and Usage (1)  and  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .



    5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Anaphylaxis and other serious hypersensitivity reactions can occur during treatment and upon re-initiation of treatment with ZELBORAF. Severe hypersensitivity reactions included generalized rash and erythema, hypotension, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome). Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF in patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



    5.4 Dermatologic Reactions



  Severe dermatologic reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, can occur in patients receiving ZELBORAF. Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF in patients who experience a severe dermatologic reaction [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.5 QT Prolongation



  Concentration-dependent QT prolongation occurred in an uncontrolled, open-label QT sub-study in previously treated patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic melanoma [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)]  . QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsade de Pointes.



 Do not start treatment in patients with uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities, QTc > 500 ms, or long QT syndrome, or in patients who are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval. Prior to and following treatment initiation or after dose modification of ZELBORAF for QTc prolongation, evaluate ECG and electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium, and calcium) after 15 days, monthly during the first 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter or more often as clinically indicated.



 Withhold ZELBORAF in patients who develop QTc > 500 ms (Grade 3). Upon recovery to QTc <= 500 ms (Grade <= 2), restart at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF treatment if the QTc interval remains > 500 ms and increased > 60 ms from pre-treatment values after controlling cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.6 Hepatotoxicity



   Liver injury leading to functional hepatic impairment, including coagulopathy or other organ dysfunction, can occur with ZELBORAF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin before initiation of treatment and monthly during treatment, or as clinically indicated. Manage laboratory abnormalities with dose reduction, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  



    Concurrent Administration with Ipilimumab  



 The safety and effectiveness of ZELBORAF in combination with ipilimumab have not been established [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ]  . In a dose-finding trial, Grade 3 increases in transaminases and bilirubin occurred in a majority of patients who received concurrent ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID) [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  



    5.7 Photosensitivity



  Mild to severe photosensitivity can occur in patients treated with ZELBORAF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing and use a broad spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen and lip balm (SPF >= 30) when outdoors.



 Institute dose modifications for intolerable Grade 2 or greater photosensitivity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.8 Ophthalmologic Reactions



  Uveitis, blurry vision, and photophobia can occur in patients treated with ZELBORAF. In Trial 1, uveitis, including iritis, occurred in 2.1% (7/336) of patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to no patients in the dacarbazine arm. Treatment with steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops may be required to manage uveitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of uveitis.



    5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  ZELBORAF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



    5.10 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall



   Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to vemurafenib treatment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].    



  Monitor patients closely when vemurafenib is administered concomitantly or sequentially with radiation treatment.

    6.1 Clinical Trial    s    Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   Partial    -    Onset Seizures  A total of 1,038 patients receiving FYCOMPA (2, 4, 8, or 12 mg once daily) constituted the safety population in the pooled analysis of the placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3) in patients with partial-onset seizures. Approximately 51% of patients were female, and the mean age was 35 years.



   Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  In controlled clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3), the rate of discontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 3%, 8%, and 19% in patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at the recommended doses of 4 mg, 8 mg, and 12 mg per day, respectively, and 5% in patients randomized to receive placebo   [see Clinical Studies (      14      )]  . The adverse reactions most commonly leading to discontinuation (>=1% in the 8 mg or 12 mg FYCOMPA group and greater than placebo) were dizziness, somnolence, vertigo, aggression, anger, ataxia, blurred vision, irritability, and dysarthria [  see     Warnings and Precautions     (      5.1      ,           5.3      )  ].



   Most Common Adverse Reactions  Table 2 gives the incidence in the controlled clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3) of the adverse reactions that occurred in >=2% of patients with partial-onset seizures in the FYCOMPA 12 mg dose group and more frequent than placebo (in order of decreasing frequency for the 12 mg dose group).



 The most common dose-related adverse reactions in patients receiving FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg or 12 mg (>=4% and occurring at least 1% higher than the placebo group) included dizziness (36%), somnolence (16%), fatigue (10%), irritability (9%), falls (7%), nausea (7%), ataxia (5%), balance disorder (4%), gait disturbance (4%), vertigo (4%), and weight gain (4%). For almost every adverse reaction, rates were higher on 12 mg and more often led to dose reduction or discontinuation.

              Primary Generalized Tonic-    Clonic Seizures  A total of 81 patients receiving FYCOMPA 8 mg once daily constituted the safety population in the placebo-controlled trial in patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (Study 4). Approximately 57% of patients were female, and the mean age was 27 years.
 

 In the controlled primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure clinical trial (Study 4), the adverse reaction profile was similar to that noted for the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3). 



 Table 3 gives the incidence of adverse reactions in patients receiving FYCOMPA 8 mg (>=4% and higher than in the placebo group) in Study 4. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving FYCOMPA (>=10% and greater than placebo) were dizziness (32%), fatigue (15%), headache (12%), somnolence (11%), and irritability (11%).



 The adverse reactions most commonly leading to discontinuation in patients receiving FYCOMPA 8 mg (>=2% and greater than placebo) were vomiting (2%) and dizziness (2%).

           Weight Gain  Weight gain has occurred with FYCOMPA.   
 

 In controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, FYCOMPA-treated adults gained an average of 1.1 kg (2.5 lbs) compared to an average of 0.3 kg (0.7 lbs) in placebo-treated adults with a median exposure of 19 weeks. The percentages of adults who gained at least 7% and 15% of their baseline body weight in FYCOMPA-treated patients were 9.1% and 0.9%, respectively, as compared to 4.5% and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, respectively. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.



 Similar increases in weight were also observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with FYCOMPA in the primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure clinical trial.



   Elevated triglycerides  Increases in triglycerides have occurred with FYCOMPA use.



   Comparison of Sex and Race  No significant sex differences were noted in the incidence of adverse reactions.



 Although there were few non-Caucasian patients, no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions compared to Caucasian patients were observed.



     6.2 Postmarketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of FYCOMPA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    5.1 Serious   P   sychiatric   and Behavioral   Reactions  



  In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, hostility- and aggression-related adverse reactions occurred in 12% and 20% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, compared to 6% of patients in the placebo group. These effects were dose-related and generally appeared within the first 6 weeks of treatment, although new events continued to be observed through more than 37 weeks. FYCOMPA-treated patients experienced more hostility- and aggression-related adverse reactions that were serious, severe, and led to dose reduction, interruption, and discontinuation more frequently than placebo-treated patients. 



 In general, in placebo-controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, neuropsychiatric events were reported more frequently in patients being treated with FYCOMPA than in patients taking placebo. These events included irritability, aggression, anger, and anxiety, which occurred in 2% or greater of FYCOMPA-treated patients and twice as frequently as in placebo-treated patients. Other symptoms that occurred with FYCOMPA and were more common than with placebo included belligerence, affect lability, agitation, and physical assault. Some of these events were reported as serious and life-threatening. Homicidal ideation and/or threat were exhibited in 0.1% of 4,368 FYCOMPA-treated patients in controlled and open label trials, including non-epilepsy trials .    Homicidal ideation and/or threat have also been reported postmarketing in patients treated with FYCOMPA.



 In the partial-onset seizure clinical trials, these events occurred in patients with and without prior psychiatric history, prior aggressive behavior, or concomitant use of medications associated with hostility and aggression. Some patients experienced worsening of their pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Patients with active psychotic disorders and unstable recurrent affective disorders were excluded from the clinical trials. The combination of alcohol and FYCOMPA significantly worsened mood and increased anger. Patients taking FYCOMPA should avoid the use of alcohol [ see   Drug Interactions (     7.3     )  ]. 



 Similar serious psychiatric and behavioral events were observed in the primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure clinical trial.



 In healthy volunteers taking FYCOMPA, observed psychiatric events included paranoia, euphoric mood, agitation, anger, mental status changes, and disorientation/confusional state. 



 In the non-epilepsy trials, psychiatric events that occurred in perampanel-treated patients more often than placebo-treated patients included disorientation, delusion, and paranoia. 



 Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that FYCOMPA may increase the risk of psychiatric events. Patients should be monitored during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of FYCOMPA, and especially when taking higher doses and during the initial few weeks of drug therapy (titration period) or at other times of dose increases. Dose of FYCOMPA should be reduced if these symptoms occur. Permanently discontinue FYCOMPA for persistent severe or worsening psychiatric symptoms or behaviors and refer for psychiatric evaluation. 



     5.   2   Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  



  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including FYCOMPA, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.



 Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.



 The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.



 The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.



 Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.
 

 Anyone considering prescribing FYCOMPA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.



 Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.



     5.   3       Neurologic Effects  



   Dizziness and   Gait Disturbance      FYCOMPA caused dose-related increases in events related to dizziness and disturbance in gait or coordination [ see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  . In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, dizziness and vertigo were reported in 35% and 47% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, compared to 10% of placebo-treated patients. The gait disturbance related events (including ataxia, gait disturbance, balance disorder, and abnormal coordination) were reported in 12% and 16% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, compared to 2% of placebo-treated patients. Elderly patients had an increased risk of these adverse reactions compared to younger adults and pediatric patients.



 These adverse reactions occurred mostly during the titration phase and led to discontinuation in 3% of FYCOMPA-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. 



 These adverse reactions were also observed in the primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure clinical trial.



  Somnolence and Fatigue  FYCOMPA caused dose-dependent increases in somnolence and fatigue-related events (including fatigue, asthenia, and lethargy).



 In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, 16% and 18% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, reported somnolence compared to 7% of placebo patients. In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, 12% and 15% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, reported fatigue-related events compared to 5% of placebo patients. Somnolence or fatigue-related events led to discontinuation in 2% of FYCOMPA-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Elderly patients had an increased risk of these adverse reactions compared to younger adults and pediatric patients.



 In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, these adverse reactions occurred mostly during the titration phase. 



 These adverse reactions were also observed in the primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure clinical trial.



  Risk Amelioration  Prescribers should advise patients against engaging in hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating motor vehicles or dangerous machinery, until the effect of FYCOMPA is known.



     5.   4   Falls  



  An increased risk of falls, in some cases leading to serious injuries including head injuries and bone fracture, occurred in patients being treated with FYCOMPA (with and without concurrent seizures). In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, falls were reported in 5% and 10% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. Falls were reported as serious and led to discontinuation more frequently in FYCOMPA-treated patients than placebo-treated patients. Elderly patients had an increased risk of falls compared to younger adults and pediatric patients.



     5.   5   Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs  



  There is the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders when antiepileptic drugs are withdrawn abruptly. FYCOMPA has a half-life of approximately 105 hours so that even after abrupt cessation, blood levels fall gradually. In epilepsy clinical trials FYCOMPA was withdrawn without down-titration. Although a small number of patients exhibited seizures following discontinuation, the data were not sufficient to allow any recommendations regarding appropriate withdrawal regimens. A gradual withdrawal is generally recommended with antiepileptic drugs, but if withdrawal is a response to adverse events, prompt withdrawal can be considered.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



  Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma   The safety of ISTODAX was evaluated in 185 patients with CTCL in 2 single arm clinical studies in which patients received a starting dose of 14 mg/m  2  . The mean duration of treatment in these studies was 5.6 months (range: <1 to 83.4 months).

   Serious Adverse Reactions



 Infections were the most common type of SAE reported in both studies with 8 patients (8%) in Study 1 and 26 patients (31%) in Study 2 experiencing a serious infection. Serious adverse reactions reported in > 2% of patients in Study 1 were sepsis and pyrexia (3%). In Study 2, serious adverse reactions in > 2% of patients were fatigue (7%), supraventricular arrhythmia, central line infection, neutropenia (6%), hypotension, hyperuricemia, edema (5%), ventricular arrhythmia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, leukopenia, dehydration, pyrexia, aspartate aminotransferase increased, sepsis, catheter related infection, hypophosphatemia and dyspnea (4%).



 Most deaths were due to disease progression. In Study 1, there were two deaths due to cardiopulmonary failure and acute renal failure. In Study 2, there were six deaths due to infection (4), myocardial ischemia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.



   

  Discontinuations



 Discontinuation due to an adverse event occurred in 21% of patients in Study 1 and 11% in Study 2. Discontinuations occurring in at least 2% of patients in either study included infection, fatigue, dyspnea, QT prolongation, and hypomagnesemia.



   Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma  



 The safety of ISTODAX was evaluated in 178 patients with PTCL in a sponsor-conducted pivotal study (Study 3) and a secondary NCI-sponsored study (Study 4) in which patients received a starting dose of 14 mg/m  2  . The mean duration of treatment and number of cycles were 5.6 months and 6 cycles in Study 3 and 9.6 months and 8 cycles in Study 4.

           Serious Adverse Reactions
 

 Infections were the most common type of SAE reported. In Study 3, 26 patients (20%) experienced a serious infection, including 6 patients (5%) with serious treatment-related infections. In Study 4, 11 patients (23%) experienced a serious infection, including 8 patients (17%) with serious treatment-related infections. Serious adverse reactions reported in >= 2% of patients in Study 3 were pyrexia (8%), pneumonia, sepsis, vomiting (5%), cellulitis, deep vein thrombosis, (4%), febrile neutropenia, abdominal pain (3%), chest pain, neutropenia, pulmonary embolism, dyspnea, and dehydration (2%). In Study 4, serious adverse reactions in >= 2 patients were pyrexia (17%), aspartate aminotransferase increased, hypotension (13%), anemia, thrombocytopenia, alanine aminotransferase increased (11%), infection, dehydration, dyspnea (9%), lymphopenia, neutropenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypocalcemia, hypoxia (6%), febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, ventricular arrhythmia, vomiting, hypersensitivity, catheter related infection, hyperuricemia, hypoalbuminemia, syncope, pneumonitis, packed red blood cell transfusion, and platelet transfusion (4%).



 Reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection has occurred in 1% of patients with PTCL patients in clinical trials in Western population enrolled in Study 3 and Study 4  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  



 Deaths due to all causes within 30 days of the last dose of ISTODAX occurred in 7% of patients in Study 3 and 17% of patients in Study 4. In Study 3, there were 5 deaths unrelated to disease progression that were due to infections, including multi-organ failure/sepsis, pneumonia, septic shock, candida sepsis, and sepsis/cardiogenic shock. In Study 4, there were 3 deaths unrelated to disease progression that were due to sepsis, aspartate aminotransferase elevation in the setting of Epstein Barr virus reactivation, and death of unknown cause.



   Discontinuations  



 Discontinuation due to an adverse event occurred in 19% of patients in Study 3 and in 28% of patients in Study 4. In Study 3, thrombocytopenia and pneumonia were the only events leading to treatment discontinuation in at least 2% of patients. In Study 4, events leading to treatment discontinuation in >= 2 patients were thrombocytopenia (11%), anemia, infection, and alanine aminotransferase increased (4%).

ISTODAX,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Myelosuppression: ISTODAX can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and anemia; monitor blood counts during treatment with ISTODAX; interrupt and/or modify the dose as necessary (  2.2  ). 
 *  Infections: Fatal and serious infections. Reactivation of DNA viruses (Epstein Barr and hepatitis B). Consider monitoring and prophylaxis in patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B (  5.2  ). 
 *  Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes: Consider cardiovascular monitoring in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, a history of significant cardiovascular disease, and patients taking medicinal products that lead to significant QT prolongation. Ensure that potassium and magnesium are within the normal range before administration of ISTODAX (  5.3  ). 
 *  Tumor lysis syndrome: Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden are at greater risk and should be closely monitored and appropriate precautions taken (  5.4  ). 
 *  Embryo-fetal toxicity: ISTODAX may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid pregnancy while receiving ISTODAX (  5.5  ,  8.1  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Myelosuppression



  Treatment with ISTODAX can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and anemia. Monitor blood counts regularly during treatment with ISTODAX, and modify the dose as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



    5.2 Infections



   Fatal and serious infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and viral reactivation, including Epstein Barr and hepatitis B viruses, have been reported in clinical trials with ISTODAX. These can occur during treatment and within 30 days after treatment. The risk of life threatening infections may be greater in patients with a history of prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed against lymphocyte antigens and in patients with disease involvement of the bone marrow [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].    



  Reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection has occurred in 1% of PTCL patients in clinical trials in Western populations [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  . In patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B infection, consider monitoring for reactivation, and consider antiviral prophylaxis.  



  Reactivation of Epstein Barr viral infection leading to liver failure has occurred in a trial of patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. In one case, ganciclovir prophylaxis failed to prevent Epstein Barr viral reactivation.  



    5.3 Electrocardiographic Changes



  Several treatment-emergent morphological changes in ECGs (including T-wave and ST-segment changes) have been reported in clinical studies. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



 In patients with congenital long QT syndrome, patients with a history of significant cardiovascular disease, and patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicines or medicinal products that lead to significant QT prolongation, consider cardiovascular monitoring of ECGs at baseline and periodically during treatment.



 Confirm that potassium and magnesium levels are within normal range before administration of ISTODAX [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



    5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported to occur in 1% of patients with tumor stage CTCL and 2% of patients with Stage III/IV PTCL. Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden may be at greater risk, should be closely monitored, and managed as appropriate.



    5.5 Use in Pregnancy



  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ISTODAX in pregnant women. However, based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ISTODAX may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproductive study, romidepsin was embryocidal and resulted in adverse effects on the developing fetus at exposures below those in patients at the recommended dose of 14 mg/m  2  /week. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking ISTODAX, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Preservative-containing or preservative-free tafluprost 0.0015% was evaluated in 905 patients in five controlled clinical studies of up to 24-months duration. The most common adverse reaction observed in patients treated with tafluprost was conjunctival hyperemia which was reported in a range of 4% to 20% of patients. Approximately 1% of patients discontinued therapy due to ocular adverse reactions.



 Ocular adverse reactions reported at an incidence of >=2% in these clinical studies included ocular stinging/irritation (7%), ocular pruritus including allergic conjunctivitis (5%), cataract (3%), dry eye (3%), ocular pain (3%), eyelash darkening (2%), growth of eyelashes (2%) and vision blurred (2%).



 Nonocular adverse reactions reported at an incidence of 2% to 6% in these clinical studies in patients treated with tafluprost 0.0015% were headache (6%), common cold (4%), cough (3%) and urinary tract infection (2%).



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tafluprost. Because postapproval adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Respiratory disorders:  exacerbation of asthma, dyspnea



   Eye disorders:  iritis/uveitis



 In postmarketing use with prostaglandin analogs, periorbital and lid changes including deepening of the eyelid sulcus have been observed.

ZIOPTAN,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Pigmentation 
    Pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid) and eyelashes can occur. Iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. (  5.1  )
 

 *  Eyelash Changes 
    Gradual changes to eyelashes including increased length, thickness and number of lashes. Usually reversible. (  5.2  )
 

 



   5.1 Pigmentation



  Tafluprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid) and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as tafluprost is administered. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of tafluprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. The long term effects of increased pigmentation are not known.



 Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with ZIOPTAN  (r)  can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly. [See Patient Counseling Information (  17.3  )].  



    5.2 Eyelash Changes



  ZIOPTAN  (r)  may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. These changes include increased length, color, thickness, shape and number of lashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.



    5.3 Intraocular Inflammation



  ZIOPTAN  (r)  should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., iritis/uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated.



    5.4 Macular Edema



  Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with prostaglandin F2alpha analogs. ZIOPTAN  (r)  should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.

  6.1       Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 A total of 162 Cushing's disease patients were exposed to SIGNIFOR in the Phase III study   [see Clinical Studies (14)]  . At study entry, patients were randomized to receive twice a day (b.i.d.) doses of either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg of SIGNIFOR given subcutaneously. The mean age of patients was approximately 40 years old with a predominance of female patients (78%). The majority of the patients had persistent or recurrent Cushing's disease (83%) and few patients (<= 5%) in either treatment group had received previous pituitary irradiation. The median exposure to the treatment was 10.4 months (0.03-37.8) with 68% of patients having at least six-months exposure.



 In the Phase III trial, adverse reactions were reported in 98% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (frequency >= 20% in either group) were diarrhea, nausea, hyperglycemia, cholelithiasis, headache, abdominal pain, fatigue, and diabetes mellitus. There were no deaths during the study. Serious adverse events were reported in 25% of patients. Adverse events leading to study discontinuation were reported in 17% of patients.



 Adverse reactions with an overall frequency higher than 5% are presented in Table 1 by randomized dose group and overall. Adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions listed first.

   Gastrointestinal Disorders  



 Gastrointestinal disorders, predominantly diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting were reported frequently in the Phase III trial (see Table 1). These events began to develop primarily during the first month of treatment with SIGNIFOR and required no intervention.



   Hyperglycemia and Diabetes  



 Hyperglycemia-related terms were reported frequently in the Phase III trial. For all patients, these terms included: hyperglycemia (40%), diabetes mellitus (18%), increased HbA1c (11%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (9%). In general, increases in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were seen soon after initiation of SIGNIFOR and were sustained during the treatment period. In the SIGNIFOR 0.6 mg group, mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels increased from 98.6 mg/dL at baseline to 125.1 mg/dL at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.9 mg group, mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels increased from 97.0 mg/dL at baseline to 128.0 mg/dL at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.6 mg group, HbA1c increased from 5.8% at baseline to 7.2% at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.9 mg group, HbA1c increased from 5.8% at baseline to 7.3% at Month 6  [see Warning and Precautions (5.2)]  .



 At one-month follow-up visits following discontinuation of SIGNIFOR, mean FPG and HbA1c levels decreased but remained above baseline values. Long-term follow-up data are not available.



   Elevated Liver Tests  



 In the Phase III trial, there were transient mean elevations in aminotransferase values in patients treated with SIGNIFOR. Mean values returned to baseline levels by Month 4 of treatment. The elevations were not associated with clinical symptoms of hepatic disease.



 In the clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 patients with concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN: one patient with Cushing's disease and three healthy volunteers  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]  . In all four cases, the elevations were noted within the first 10 days of treatment. In all of these cases, total bilirubin elevations were seen either concomitantly or preceding the transaminase elevation. The patient with Cushing's disease developed jaundice. All four cases had resolution of the laboratory abnormalities with discontinuation of SIGNIFOR.



   Hypocortisolism  



 Cases of hypocortisolism were reported in the Phase III study in Cushing's disease patients  [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14)]  . The majority of cases were manageable by reducing the dose of SIGNIFOR and/or adding low-dose, short-term glucocorticoid therapy  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .



   Injection Site Reactions  



 Injection site reactions were reported in 17% of patients enrolled in the Phase III trial in Cushing's disease. The events were most frequently reported as local pain, erythema, hematoma, hemorrhage, and pruritus. These events resolved spontaneously and required no intervention.



   Thyroid Function  



 Hypothyroidism with the use of SIGNIFOR was reported for seven patients participating in the Phase III study in Cushing's disease. All seven patients presented with a TSH close to or below the lower limit at study entry which precludes establishing a conclusive relationship between the adverse event and the use of SIGNIFOR.



   Other Abnormal Laboratory Findings  



 Asymptomatic and reversible elevations in lipase and amylase were observed in patients receiving SIGNIFOR in clinical studies. Pancreatitis is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of somatostatin analogs due to the association between cholelithiasis and acute pancreatitis.



 For hemoglobin levels, mean decreases that remained within normal range were observed. Also, post-baseline elevations in PT and PTT were noted in 33% and 47% of patients, respectively. The PT and PTT elevations were minimal. 



 These laboratory findings are of unclear clinical significance.

SIGNIFOR,warnings and precautions,"     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *   Hypocortisolism:  Decreases in circulating levels of cortisol may occur resulting in biochemical and/or clinical hypocortisolism. SIGNIFOR dose reduction or interruption and/or adding a low-dose short-term glucocorticoid may be necessary (  5.1  ) 
 *   Hyperglycemia and Diabetes  (occurs with initiation): Intensive glucose monitoring is recommended and may require initiation or adjustment of anti-diabetic treatment per standard of care (  5.2  ) 
 *   Bradycardia and QT Prolongation:  Use with caution in at-risk patients; ECG testing prior to dosing and on treatment (  5.3  ,  7.1  ) 
 *   Liver Test Elevations:  Evaluate liver tests prior to and during treatment (  5.4  ) 
 *   Cholelithiasis:  Perform gallbladder ultrasounds before starting treatment and at 6-month intervals (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1       Hypocortisolism



  Treatment with SIGNIFOR leads to suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion in Cushing's disease. Suppression of ACTH may lead to a decrease in circulating levels of cortisol and potentially hypocortisolism.



 Monitor and instruct patients on the signs and symptoms associated with hypocortisolism (e.g., weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hyponatremia or hypoglycemia). If hypocortisolism occurs, consider temporary dose reduction or interruption of treatment with SIGNIFOR, as well as temporary, exogenous glucocorticoid replacement therapy.



    5.2       Hyperglycemia and Diabetes 



  Elevations in blood glucose levels have been seen in healthy volunteers and patients treated with SIGNIFOR. In the Phase III trial, the development of pre-diabetes and diabetes was observed  [see Clinical Studies (14)]  . In this trial, nearly all patients-including those with normal glucose status at baseline, pre-diabetes, and diabetes-developed worsening glycemia in the first two weeks of treatment. Cushing's disease patients with poor glycemic control (as defined by HbA1c values >8% while receiving anti-diabetic therapy) may be at a higher risk of developing severe hyperglycemia and associated complications, e.g., ketoacidosis. 



 Because of this predictable adverse reaction, the glycemic status [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)] should be assessed prior to starting treatment with SIGNIFOR. In patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus intensive anti-diabetic therapy should be optimized prior to treatment with SIGNIFOR. Self-monitoring of blood glucose and/or FPG assessments should be done every week for the first two to three months and periodically thereafter, as clinically appropriate, as well as over the first two to four weeks after any dose increase. After treatment discontinuation, glycemic monitoring (e.g., FPG or HbA1c) should be done according to clinical practice. Patients who were initiated on anti-diabetic therapy as a result of SIGNIFOR may require closer monitoring after discontinuation of SIGNIFOR, especially if the anti-diabetic therapy has a risk of causing hypoglycemia.



 If hyperglycemia develops in a patient treated with SIGNIFOR, the initiation or adjustment of anti-diabetic treatment per standard of care is recommended. The optimal treatment for the management of SIGNIFOR-induced hyperglycemia is not known. If uncontrolled hyperglycemia persists, despite appropriate medical management, the dose of SIGNIFOR should be reduced or discontinued.



    5.3       Bradycardia and QT Prolongation



   Bradycardia  



 Bradycardia has been reported with the use of SIGNIFOR  [see Adverse Reactions (6)]  . Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be carefully monitored. Dose adjustments of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary.



  QT Prolongation  



 SIGNIFOR is associated with QT prolongation. In two thorough QT studies with SIGNIFOR, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses. SIGNIFOR should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc, such as those:



 *  with congenital long QT prolongation. 
 *  with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia. 
 *  on anti-arrhythmic therapy or other substances that are known to lead to QT prolongation. 
 *  with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia. 
    A baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy with SIGNIFOR and monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to SIGNIFOR administration and should be monitored periodically during therapy. 
 

    5.4       Liver Test Elevations



  In the Phase III trial, 5% of patients had an ALT or AST level greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the entire clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 cases of concurrent elevations in ALT (alanine aminotransferase) greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN: one patient with Cushing's disease and three healthy volunteers [see Adverse Reactions (6   )]  . In these cases, total bilirubin elevations were seen either concomitantly or preceding the transaminase elevation.



 Monitoring of liver tests should be done after 1 to 2 weeks on treatment, then monthly for 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter. If ALT is normal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3-5 times the ULN are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or within 48 hours if exceeding 5 times ULN. If ALT is abnormal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3-5 times the baseline values are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or sooner if exceeding 5 times ULN. Tests should be done in a laboratory that can provide same-day results. If the values are confirmed or rising, interrupt SIGNIFOR treatment and investigate for probable cause of the findings, which may or may not be SIGNIFOR-related. Serial measures of ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, should be done weekly, or more frequently, if any value exceeds 5 times the baseline value in case of abnormal baselines or 5 times the ULN in case of normal baselines. If resolution of abnormalities to normal or near normal occurs, resuming treatment with SIGNIFOR may be done cautiously, with close observation, and only if some other likely cause has been found.



    5.5       Cholelithiasis 



  Cholelithiasis has been frequently reported in clinical studies with SIGNIFOR  [see Adverse Reactions (6)]  . Ultrasonic examination of the gallbladder before, and at 6- to 12-month intervals during SIGNIFOR therapy is recommended.



    5.6       Monitoring for Deficiency of Pituitary Hormones



  As the pharmacological activity of SIGNIFOR mimics that of somatostatin, inhibition of pituitary hormones, other than ACTH, may occur. Monitoring of pituitary function (e.g., TSH/free T4, GH/IGF-1) should occur prior to initiation of therapy with SIGNIFOR and periodically during treatment should be considered as clinically appropriate. Patients who have undergone transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation are particularly at increased risk for deficiency of pituitary hormones.

SOVALDI,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:



 *  Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone and Another HCV Direct Acting Antiviral [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ] . 
      EXCERPT:   The most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 20%, all grades) observed with SOVALDI in combination with ribavirin were fatigue and headache. The most common adverse events observed with SOVALDI in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia and anemia. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 When SOVALDI is administered with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, refer to the respective prescribing information for a description of adverse reactions associated with their use.



 The safety assessment of SOVALDI was based on pooled Phase 3 clinical trial data (both controlled and uncontrolled) including:



 *  650 subjects who received SOVALDI + ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy for 12 weeks, 
 *  98 subjects who received SOVALDI + ribavirin combination therapy for 16 weeks, 
 *  250 subjects who received SOVALDI + ribavirin combination therapy for 24 weeks, 
 *  327 subjects who received SOVALDI + peginterferon (Peg-IFN) alfa + ribavirin combination therapy for 12 weeks, 
 *  243 subjects who received peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 24 weeks, and 
 *  71 subjects who received placebo (PBO) for 12 weeks [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ] . 
    The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 4% for subjects receiving placebo, 1% for subjects receiving SOVALDI + ribavirin for 12 weeks, less than 1% for subjects receiving SOVALDI + ribavirin for 24 weeks, 11% for subjects receiving peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 24 weeks and 2% for subjects receiving SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 12 weeks.
 

 Adverse events observed in at least 15% of subjects in the Phase 3 clinical trials outlined above are provided in Table 2. A side-by-side tabulation is displayed to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.



 The most common adverse events (at least 20%) for SOVALDI + ribavirin combination therapy were fatigue and headache. The most common adverse events (at least 20%) for SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin combination therapy were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia and anemia.

                Bilirubin Elevations  
 

 Total bilirubin elevation of more than 2.5*ULN was observed in none of the subjects in the SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 12 weeks group and in 1%, 3% and 3% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 24 weeks, SOVALDI + ribavirin 12 weeks and SOVALDI + ribavirin 24 weeks groups, respectively. Bilirubin levels peaked during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment and subsequently decreased and returned to baseline levels by post-treatment Week 4. These bilirubin elevations were not associated with transaminase elevations.



     Creatine Kinase Elevations  



 Creatine kinase was assessed in the FISSION and NEUTRINO trials. Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation of greater than or equal to 10*ULN was observed in less than 1%, 1% and 2% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 24 weeks, SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 12 weeks and SOVALDI + ribavirin 12 weeks groups, respectively.



     Lipase Elevations  



 Isolated, asymptomatic lipase elevation of greater than 3*ULN was observed in less than 1%, 2%, 2%, and 2% of subjects in the SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 12 weeks, SOVALDI + ribavirin 12 weeks, SOVALDI + ribavirin 24 weeks and peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 24 weeks groups, respectively.



     Patients with HCV/HIV-1 Co-infection  



 SOVALDI used in combination with ribavirin was assessed in 223 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects  [see  Clinical Studies (14.4)  ]  . The safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. Elevated total bilirubin (grade 3 or 4) was observed in 30/32 (94%) subjects receiving atazanavir as part of the antiretroviral regimen. None of the subjects had concomitant transaminase increases. Among subjects not taking atazanavir, grade 3 or 4 elevated total bilirubin was observed in 2 (1.5%) subjects, similar to the rate observed with HCV mono-infected subjects receiving SOVALDI + ribavirin in Phase 3 trials.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of SOVALDI. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     Cardiac Disorders

SOVALDI,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Bradycardia with amiodarone coadministration: Serious symptomatic bradycardia may occur in patients taking amiodarone and SOVALDI in combination with another direct acting antiviral (DAA), particularly in patients also receiving beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease. Coadministration of amiodarone with SOVALDI in combination with another DAA is not recommended. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. (  5.1  ,  6.2  ,  7.1  ) 
 *  Use with other drugs containing sofosbuvir is not recommended (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone and Another HCV Direct Acting Antiviral



   Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with SOVALDI in combination with an investigational agent (NS5A inhibitor) or simeprevir. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient receiving a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir)). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.  



  Coadministration of amiodarone with SOVALDI in combination with another direct acting antiviral (DAA) is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered SOVALDI and another DAA:  



 *   Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia  
 *   Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.  
     Patients who are taking SOVALDI in combination with another DAA who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  
 

  Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting SOVALDI in combination with a DAA should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  



  Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .  



    5.2 Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers



   Drugs that are P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of SOVALDI. The use of rifampin and St. John's wort with SOVALDI is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .  



    5.3 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment



   Because SOVALDI is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for treatment of HCV infection, consult the prescribing information for these drugs used in combination with SOVALDI. Warnings and Precautions related to these drugs also apply to their use in SOVALDI combination treatment.  



    5.4 Related Products Not Recommended



   The use of SOVALDI with other products containing sofosbuvir is not recommended.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Adverse Reactions when Used in Combination with Peg-IFN-Alfa and RBV  



 The safety profile of OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who were treatment-naive or who had previously relapsed following interferon therapy with or without RBV is based on pooled data from three Phase 3 trials  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . These trials included a total of 1178 subjects who received OLYSIO or placebo in combination with 24 or 48 weeks of Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Of the 1178 subjects, 781 subjects were randomized to receive OLYSIO 150 mg once daily for 12 weeks and 397 subjects were randomized to receive placebo once daily for 12 weeks.



 In the pooled Phase 3 safety data, the majority of the adverse reactions reported during 12 weeks treatment with OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV were Grade 1 to 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were reported in 23% of subjects receiving OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV versus 25% of subjects receiving placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 2% of subjects receiving OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV and in 3% of subjects receiving placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Discontinuation of OLYSIO or placebo due to adverse reactions occurred in 2% and 1% of subjects receiving OLYSIO with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV and subjects receiving placebo with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, respectively.



 The following table lists adverse reactions (all Grades) that occurred with at least 3% higher frequency among subjects receiving OLYSIO 150 mg once daily in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, compared to subjects receiving placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, during the first 12 weeks of treatment in the pooled Phase 3 trials in subjects who were treatment-naive or who had previously relapsed after Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV therapy (see  Table 4  ).

             Rash and Photosensitivity  
 

 In the Phase 3 clinical trials, rash (including photosensitivity reactions) was observed in 28% of OLYSIO-treated subjects compared to 20% of placebo-treated subjects during the 12 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO or placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Fifty-six percent (56%) of rash events in the OLYSIO group occurred in the first 4 weeks, with 42% of cases occurring in the first 2 weeks. Most of the rash events in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or Grade 2). Severe (Grade 3) rash occurred in 1% of OLYSIO-treated subjects and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. There were no reports of life-threatening (Grade 4) rash. Discontinuation of OLYSIO or placebo due to rash occurred in 1% of OLYSIO-treated subjects, compared to less than 1% of placebo-treated subjects. The frequencies of rash and photosensitivity reactions were higher in subjects with higher simeprevir exposures.



 All subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 trials were directed to use sun protection measures. In these trials, adverse reactions under the specific category of photosensitivity were reported in 5% of OLYSIO-treated subjects compared to 1% of placebo-treated subjects during the 12 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO or placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Most photosensitivity reactions in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2). Two OLYSIO-treated subjects experienced photosensitivity reactions which resulted in hospitalization. No life-threatening photosensitivity reactions were reported.



     Dyspnea  



 During the 12 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO, dyspnea was reported in 12% of OLYSIO-treated subjects compared to 8% of placebo-treated subjects (all grades; pooled Phase 3 trials). All dyspnea events reported in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2). There were no Grade 3 or 4 dyspnea events reported and no subjects discontinued treatment with OLYSIO due to dyspnea. Sixty-one percent (61%) of dyspnea events occurred in the first 4 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO.



     Laboratory abnormalities  



 There were no differences between treatment groups for the following laboratory parameters: hemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, or serum creatinine. Laboratory abnormalities that were observed at a higher incidence in OLYSIO-treated subjects than in placebo-treated subjects are listed in Table 5.

          Elevations in bilirubin were predominately mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity, and included elevation of both direct and indirect bilirubin. Elevations in bilirubin occurred early after treatment initiation, peaking by study Week 2, and were rapidly reversible upon cessation of OLYSIO. Bilirubin elevations were generally not associated with elevations in liver transaminases. The frequency of elevated bilirubin was higher in subjects with higher simeprevir exposures.
 

     Adverse Reactions when Used with Sofosbuvir  



 In the COSMOS trial, the most common (> 10%) adverse reactions reported during 12 weeks treatment with OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir without RBV were fatigue (25%), headache (21%), nausea (21%), insomnia (14%) and pruritus (11%). Rash and photosensitivity were reported in 11% and 7% of subjects, respectively. During 24 weeks treatment with OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir, dizziness (16%), and diarrhea (16%) were also commonly reported.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been reported during post approval use of OLYSIO. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship between drug exposure and these adverse reactions.

   5.1 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Co-administered with Sofosbuvir and Amiodarone



  Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is co-administered with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct acting antiviral, including OLYSIO. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient receiving a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with co-administration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this bradycardia effect is unknown.



 Co-administration of amiodarone with OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative treatment options, and who will be co-administered OLYSIO and sofosbuvir:



 *   Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia  
 *   Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of co-administration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.  
    Patients who are taking sofosbuvir in combination with OLYSIO who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.
 

 Due to amiodarone's long elimination half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting sofosbuvir in combination with OLYSIO should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.



 Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion or memory problems [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  and  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .



    5.2 Hepatic Decompensation and Hepatic Failure



   Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported postmarketing in patients treated with OLYSIO in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin or in combination with sofosbuvir. Most cases were reported in patients with advanced and/or decompensated cirrhosis who are at increased risk for hepatic decompensation or hepatic failure. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between treatment with OLYSIO and these events has not been established [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .  



  OLYSIO is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.8)  ].    



  In clinical trials of OLYSIO, modest increases in bilirubin levels were observed without impacting hepatic function [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation with markedly elevated bilirubin levels have been reported. Monitor liver chemistry tests before and as clinically indicated during OLYSIO combination therapy. Patients who experience an increase in total bilirubin to greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal should be closely monitored:  



 *   Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if they have onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discolored feces.  
 *   Discontinue OLYSIO if elevation in bilirubin is accompanied by liver transaminase increases or clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation.  
       5.3 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Associated With Combination Treatment
 

   OLYSIO should be used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of CHC infection. Therefore, consult the prescribing information for these drugs before starting therapy with OLYSIO. Warnings and Precautions related to these drugs also apply to their use in OLYSIO combination treatment.  



    5.4 Photosensitivity



   Photosensitivity reactions have been observed with OLYSIO combination therapy. Serious photosensitivity reactions resulting in hospitalization have been observed with OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Photosensitivity reactions occurred most frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment, but can occur at any time during treatment.  Photosensitivity may present as an exaggerated sunburn reaction, usually affecting areas exposed to light (typically the face, ""V"" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, and dorsa of the hands). Manifestations may include burning, erythema, exudation, blistering, and edema.



  Use sun protective measures and limit sun exposure during treatment with OLYSIO. Avoid use of tanning devices during treatment with OLYSIO.  Discontinuation of OLYSIO should be considered if a photosensitivity reaction occurs and patients should be monitored until the reaction has resolved. If a decision is made to continue OLYSIO in the setting of a photosensitivity reaction, expert consultation is advised.



    5.5 Rash



   Rash has been observed with OLYSIO combination therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Rash occurred most frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment, but can occur at any time during treatment. Severe rash and rash requiring discontinuation of OLYSIO have been reported in subjects receiving OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV.  Most of the rash events in OLYSIO-treated patients were of mild or moderate severity [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Patients with mild to moderate rashes should be followed for possible progression of rash, including the development of mucosal signs (e.g., oral lesions, conjunctivitis) or systemic symptoms. If the rash becomes severe, OLYSIO should be discontinued. Patients should be monitored until the rash has resolved.



    5.6 Sulfa Allergy



  OLYSIO contains a sulfonamide moiety. In subjects with a history of sulfa allergy (n=16), no increased incidence of rash or photosensitivity reactions has been observed. However, there are insufficient data to exclude an association between sulfa allergy and the frequency or severity of adverse reactions observed with the use of OLYSIO.



    5.7 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions



   Co-administration of OLYSIO with substances that are moderate or strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) is not recommended as this may lead to significantly lower or higher exposure of simeprevir, respectively, which may result in reduced therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see  Drug Interactions (7)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of PLEGRIDY cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2), a total of 1468 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis received PLEGRIDY for up to 177 weeks (41 months), with an overall exposure equivalent to 1932 person-years. A total of 1093 patients received at least 1 year, and 415 patients at least 2 years of treatment with PLEGRIDY. A total of 512 and 500 patients, respectively, received PLEGRIDY 125 micrograms every 14 days or every 28 days during the placebo-controlled phase of Study 1 (year 1). The experience in year 2 of Study 1 and in the 2-year safety extension study (Study 2) was consistent with the experience in the 1-year placebo-controlled phase of Study 1.



 In the placebo-controlled phase of Study 1, the most common adverse drug reactions for PLEGRIDY 125 micrograms subcutaneously every 14 days were injection site erythema, influenza-like illness, pyrexia, headache, myalgia, chills, injection site pain, asthenia, injection site pruritus, and arthralgia (all had incidence more than 10% and at least 2% more than placebo). The most commonly reported adverse event leading to discontinuation in patients treated with PLEGRIDY 125 micrograms subcutaneously every 14 days was influenza-like illness (in less than 1% of patients).



   Table 2  summarizes adverse reactions reported over 48 weeks from patients treated in the placebo-controlled phase of Study 1 who received subcutaneous PLEGRIDY 125 micrograms (n=512), or placebo (n=500), every 14 days.

             Immunogenicity  
 

 For therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In Study 1, fewer than 1% of patients treated with PLEGRIDY every 14 days for 1 year developed neutralizing antibodies. Approximately 7% of PLEGRIDY-treated patients developed antibodies to PEG.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to PLEGRIDY with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   Flu-Like Symptoms  



 Influenza-like illness was experienced by 47% of patients receiving PLEGRIDY 125 micrograms every 14 days and 13% of patients receiving placebo. Fewer than 1% of PLEGRIDY-treated patients in Study 1 discontinued treatment due to flu-like symptoms.

PLEGRIDY,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hepatic injury: monitor liver function tests; monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury; consider discontinuation of PLEGRIDY if hepatic injury occurs (  5.1  ) 
 *  Depression and suicide: advise patients to report immediately any symptom of depression or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider; consider discontinuation of PLEGRIDY if depression occurs (  5.2  ) 
 *  Seizure: Seizures are associated with the use of interferon beta. Exercise caution when administering PLEGRIDY to patients with a seizure disorder (  5.3  ) 
 *  Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions: serious allergic reactions have been reported as a rare complication of treatment with interferon beta. Discontinue PLEGRIDY if a serious allergic reaction occurs (  5.4  ) 
 *  Injection site reactions: change injection site or consider discontinuation of PLEGRIDY if there is necrosis (  5.5  ) 
 *  Congestive heart failure: monitor patients with pre-existing significant cardiac disease for worsening of cardiac symptoms (  5.6  ) 
 *  Decreased peripheral blood counts: monitor complete blood counts (  5.7  ) 
 *  Autoimmune disorders: consider discontinuation of PLEGRIDY if a new autoimmune disorder occurs (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hepatic Injury



  Severe hepatic injury, including hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and rare cases of severe hepatic failure, have been reported with interferon beta. Asymptomatic elevation of hepatic transaminases has also been reported, and in some patients has recurred upon rechallenge with interferon beta.



 Elevations in hepatic enzymes and hepatic injury have been observed with the use of PLEGRIDY in clinical studies. The incidence of increases in hepatic transaminases was greater in patients taking PLEGRIDY than in those taking placebo. The incidence of elevations of alanine aminotransferase above 5 times the upper limit of normal was 1% in placebo-treated patients and 2% in PLEGRIDY-treated patients. The incidence of elevations of aspartate aminotransferase above 5 times the upper limit of normal was less than 1% in placebo-treated patients and less than 1% in PLEGRIDY-treated patients. Elevations of serum hepatic transaminases combined with elevated bilirubin occurred in 2 patients. Both cases resolved following discontinuation of PLEGRIDY.



 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury.



    5.2 Depression and Suicide



  Depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide occur more frequently in patients receiving interferon beta than in patients receiving placebo.



 In clinical studies, the overall incidence of adverse events related to depression and suicidal ideation in multiple sclerosis patients was 8% in both the PLEGRIDY and placebo groups. The incidence of serious events related to depression and suicidal ideation was similar and less than 1% in both groups.



 Advise patients to report immediately any symptom of depression or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider. If a patient develops depression or other severe psychiatric symptoms, consider stopping treatment with PLEGRIDY.



    5.3 Seizures



  Seizures are associated with the use of interferon beta.



 The incidence of seizures in multiple sclerosis clinical studies was less than 1% in patients receiving PLEGRIDY and placebo.



 Exercise caution when administering PLEGRIDY to patients with a seizure disorder.



    5.4 Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions



  Anaphylaxis and other serious allergic reactions are rare complications of treatment with interferon beta.



 Less than 1% of PLEGRIDY-treated patients experienced a serious allergic reaction such as angioedema or urticaria. Those who did have serious allergic reactions recovered promptly after treatment with antihistamines or corticosteroids.



 Discontinue PLEGRIDY if a serious allergic reaction occurs.



    5.5 Injection Site Reactions



  Injection site reactions, including injection site necrosis, can occur with the use of subcutaneous interferon beta.



 In clinical studies, the incidence of injection site reactions (e.g., injection site erythema, pain, pruritus, or edema) was 66% in the PLEGRIDY group and 11% in the placebo group; the incidence of severe injection site reactions was 3% in the PLEGRIDY group and 0% in the placebo group. One patient out of 1468 patients who received PLEGRIDY in clinical studies experienced injection site necrosis. The injury resolved with standard medical treatment.



 Decisions to discontinue therapy following necrosis at a single injection site should be based on the extent of the necrosis. For patients who continue therapy with PLEGRIDY after injection site necrosis has occurred, avoid administration of PLEGRIDY near the affected area until it is fully healed. If multiple lesions occur, discontinue PLEGRIDY until healing occurs.



    5.6 Congestive Heart Failure



  Congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure occur in patients receiving interferon beta.



 In clinical studies, the incidence of cardiovascular events was 7% in both PLEGRIDY and placebo treatment groups. No serious cardiovascular events were reported in the PLEGRIDY group.



 Monitor patients with significant cardiac disease for worsening of their cardiac condition during initiation and continuation of treatment with PLEGRIDY.



    5.7 Decreased Peripheral Blood Counts



  Interferon beta can cause decreased peripheral blood counts in all cell lines, including rare instances of pancytopenia and severe thrombocytopenia.



 In clinical studies, decreases in white blood cell counts below 3.0 x 10  9  /L occurred in 7% of patients receiving PLEGRIDY and in 1% receiving placebo. There is no apparent association between decreases in white blood cell counts and an increased risk of infections or serious infections. The incidence of clinically significant decreases in lymphocyte counts (below 0.5 x 10  9  /L), neutrophil counts (below 1.0 x 10  9  /L), and platelet counts (below 100 x 10  9  /L) were all less than 1% and similar in both placebo and PLEGRIDY groups. Two serious cases were reported in patients treated with PLEGRIDY: one patient (less than 1%) experienced severe thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count less than or equal to 10 x 10  9  /L), and another patient (less than 1%) experienced severe neutropenia (defined as a neutrophil count less than or equal to 0.5 x 10  9  /L). In both patients, cell counts recovered after discontinuation of PLEGRIDY. Compared to placebo, there were no significant differences in red blood cell counts in patients treated with PLEGRIDY.



 Monitor patients for infections, bleeding, and symptoms of anemia. Monitor complete blood cell counts, differential white blood cell counts, and platelet counts during treatment with PLEGRIDY. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of blood cell counts.



    5.8 Autoimmune Disorders



  Autoimmune disorders of multiple target organs including idiopathic thrombocytopenia, hyper- and hypothyroidism, and autoimmune hepatitis have been reported with interferon beta.



 In clinical studies, the incidence of autoimmune disorders was less than 1% in both PLEGRIDY and placebo treatment groups.



 If patients develop a new autoimmune disorder, consider stopping PLEGRIDY.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections  



 The two Phase 3 cSSSI clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) for VIBATIV included 929 adult patients treated with VIBATIV at 10 mg/kg IV once daily. The mean age of patients treated with VIBATIV was 49 years (range 18-96). There was a slight male predominance (56%) in patients treated with VIBATIV, and patients were predominantly Caucasian (78%).



 In the cSSSI clinical trials, <1% (8/929) patients who received VIBATIV died and <1% (8/938) patients treated with vancomycin died. Serious adverse events were reported in 7% (69/929) of patients treated with VIBATIV and most commonly included renal, respiratory, or cardiac events. Serious adverse events were reported in 5% (43/938) of vancomycin-treated patients, and most commonly included cardiac, respiratory, or infectious events. Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 8% (72/929) of patients treated with VIBATIV, the most common events being nausea and rash (~1% each). Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 6% (53/938) of vancomycin-treated patients, the most common events being rash and pruritus (~1% each).



 The most common adverse events occurring in >=10% of VIBATIV-treated patients observed in the VIBATIV Phase 3 cSSSI trials were taste disturbance, nausea, vomiting, and foamy urine.

 Two randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) for VIBATIV included 1,503 adult patients treated with VIBATIV at 10 mg/kg IV once daily or vancomycin at 1 g IV twice daily. The mean age of patients treated with VIBATIV was 62 years (range 18-100). In patients treated with VIBATIV, 69% of the patients were white and 65% were male. In the combined VIBATIV group, 29% were VAP and 71% were HAP patients.



   Table 5  summarizes deaths using Kaplan-Meier estimates at Day 28 as stratified by baseline creatinine clearance categorized into four groups. Patients with pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (CrCl<=50 mL/min) who were treated with VIBATIV for HABP/VABP had increased mortality observed versus vancomycin in both the trials.

             Serious adverse events were reported in 31% of patients treated with VIBATIV and 26% of patients who received vancomycin. Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 8% (60/751) of patients who received VIBATIV, the most common events being acute renal failure and electrocardiogram QTc interval prolonged (~1% each). Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 5% (40/752) of vancomycin-patients, the most common events being septic shock and multi-organ failure (<1%).

     Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections  



 In cSSSI trials, the incidence of renal adverse events indicative of renal impairment (increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, renal insufficiency, and/or renal failure) was 30/929 (3%) of VIBATIV-treated patients compared with 10/938 (1%) of vancomycin-treated patients. In 17 of the 30 VIBATIV-treated patients, these adverse events had not completely resolved by the end of the trials, compared with 6 of the 10 vancomycin-treated patients. Serious adverse events indicative of renal impairment occurred in 11/929 (1%) of VIBATIV-treated patients compared with 3/938 (0.3%) of vancomycin-treated patients. Twelve patients treated with VIBATIV discontinued treatment due to adverse events indicative of renal impairment compared with 2 patients treated with vancomycin.



 Increases in serum creatinine to 1.5 times baseline occurred more frequently among VIBATIV-treated patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (15%) compared with vancomycin-treated patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (7%).



 Fifteen of 174 (9%) VIBATIV-treated patients >=65 years of age had adverse events indicative of renal impairment compared with 16 of 755 patients (2%) <65 years of age [see  Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )  ].



     Hospital-Acquired and Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia  



 In the HABP/VABP trials, the incidence of renal adverse events (increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, renal insufficiency, and/or renal failure) was 10% for VIBATIV vs. 8% for vancomycin. Of the patients who had at least one renal adverse event, 54% in each treatment group recovered completely, recovered with sequelae, or were improving from the renal AE at the last visit.  Three percent of VIBATIV-treated patients and 2% of vancomycin-treated patients experienced at least one serious renal adverse event. Renal adverse events resulted in discontinuation of study medication in 14 VIBATIV-treated patients (2%) and 7 vancomycin-treated patients (1%).



 Increases in serum creatinine to 1.5 times baseline occurred more frequently among VIBATIV-treated patients (16%) compared with vancomycin-treated patients (10%).



 Forty-four of 399 (11.0%) VIBATIV-treated patients >=65 years of age had adverse events indicative of renal impairment compared with 30 of 352 patients (8%) <65 years of age [see  Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )  ].



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIBATIV. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after first or subsequent doses of VIBATIV, including anaphylactic reactions. It is unknown if patients with hypersensitivity reactions to vancomycin will experience cross-reactivity to telavancin. [see  Hypersensitivity Reactions (  5.6  )  ]

   5.1 Increased Mortality in Patients with HABP/VABP and Pre-existing Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment (CrCl<=50 mL/min)



  In the analysis of patients (classified by the treatment received) in the two combined HABP/VABP trials with pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (CrCl<=50 mL/min), all-cause mortality within 28 days of starting treatment was 95/241 (39%) in the VIBATIV group, compared with 72/243 (30%) in the vancomycin group.  All-cause mortality at 28 days in patients without pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (CrCl>50 mL/min) was 86/510 (17%) in the VIBATIV group and 92/510 (18%) in the vancomycin group. Therefore, VIBATIV use in patients with baseline CrCl<=50 mL/min should be considered only when the anticipated benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk [see Adverse Reactions, Clinical Trials Experience (  6.1  )  and Clinical Trials, HABP/VABP (  14.2  )  ].



    5.2 Decreased Clinical Response in Patients with cSSSI and Pre-existing Moderate/Severe Renal Impairment (CrCl<=50 mL/min)



  In a subgroup analysis of the combined cSSSI trials,clinical cure rates in the VIBATIV-treated patients were lower in patients with baseline CrCl <=50 mL/min compared with those with CrCl>50 mL/min (  Table 2  ). A decrease of this magnitude was not observed in vancomycin-treated patients. Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for use in patients with cSSSI and with baseline moderate/severe renal impairment.

            5.3 Nephrotoxicity
 

  In both the HABP/VABP trials and the cSSSI trials, renal adverse events were more likely to occur in patients with baseline comorbidities known to predispose patients to kidney dysfunction (pre-existing renal disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, or hypertension). The renal adverse event rates were also higher in patients who received concomitant medications known to affect kidney function (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ACE inhibitors, and loop diuretics).



 Monitor renal function (i.e., serum creatinine, creatinine clearance) in all patients receiving VIBATIV. Values should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment (at 48- to 72-hour intervals or more frequently, if clinically indicated), and at the end of therapy. If renal function decreases, the benefit of continuing VIBATIV versus discontinuing and initiating therapy with an alternative agent should be assessed [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), Adverse Reactions (  6  ),  and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].



 In patients with renal dysfunction, accumulation of the solubilizer hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin can occur [see Patients with Renal Impairment (  8.6  )  and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].



    5.4 Pregnant Women and Women of Childbearing Potential



  Avoid use of VIBATIV during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. VIBATIV caused adverse developmental outcomes in 3 animal species at clinically relevant doses. This raises concern about potential adverse developmental outcomes in humans.



 Women of childbearing potential should have a serum pregnancy test prior to administration of VIBATIV. If not already pregnant, women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during VIBATIV treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ].



    5.5 Coagulation Test Interference



  Although telavancin does not interfere with coagulation, it interfered with certain tests used to monitor coagulation (  Table 3  ), when conducted using samples drawn 0 to 18 hours after VIBATIV administration for patients being treated once every 24 hours. Blood samples for these coagulation tests should be collected as close as possible prior to a patient's next dose of VIBATIV. Blood samples for coagulation tests unaffected by VIBATIV may be collected at any time [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )  ].



 For patients who require aPTT monitoring while being treated with VIBATIV, a non phospholipid dependent coagulation test such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT monitoring may be considered.



 Table 3: Coagulation Tests Affected and Unaffected by Telavancin

                                                          Fibrin degradation products


        No evidence of increased bleeding risk has been observed in clinical trials with VIBATIV. Telavancin has no effect on platelet aggregation. Furthermore, no evidence of hypercoagulability has been seen, as healthy subjects receiving VIBATIV have normal levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products.
 

    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur after first or subsequent doses. Discontinue VIBATIV at first sign of skin rash, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Telavancin is a semi-synthetic derivative of vancomycin; it is unknown if patients with hypersensitivity reactions to vancomycin will experience cross-reactivity to telavancin. VIBATIV should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to vancomycin [see Postmarketing Experience (  6.2  )  ].



    5.7 Infusion-Related Reactions



  VIBATIV is a lipoglycopeptide antibacterial agent and should be administered over a period of 60 minutes to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions. Rapid intravenous infusions of the glycopeptide class of antimicrobial agents can cause ""Red-man Syndrome""-like reactions including: flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritus, or rash. Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these reactions.



    5.8 Clostridium difficile  -Associated Diarrhea



   Clostridium difficile-  associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hyper-toxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, since these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



    5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria



  Prescribing VIBATIV in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



 As with other antibacterial drugs, use of VIBATIV may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Patients should be carefully monitored during therapy. If superinfection occurs, appropriate measures should be taken.



    5.10 QTc Prolongation



  In a study involving healthy volunteers, doses of 7.5 and 15 mg/kg of VIBATIV prolonged the QTc interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )  ]. Caution is warranted when prescribing VIBATIV to patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, known prolongation of the QTc interval, uncompensated heart failure, or severe left ventricular hypertrophy were not included in clinical trials of VIBATIV. Use of VIBATIV should be avoided in patients with these conditions.

Observe for hypersensitivity signs and symptoms following Lymphoseek injection.  Have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel immediately available. (  5.1  )  



 



   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



   Lymphoseek may pose a risk of hypersensitivity reactions due to its chemical similarity to dextran [see  Description (11)  ]  .  Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with dextran and modified forms of dextran (such as iron dextran drugs).  



 Before administering Lymphoseek, ask patients about prior hypersensitivity reactions to drugs, especially to dextran and modified forms of dextran.  Have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel immediately available at the time of Lymphoseek administration.



    5.2 Radiation Risks



   Any radiation-emitting product may increase the risk for cancer, especially in pediatric patients.  Adhere to the dose recommendations and ensure safe handling to minimize the risk for excessive radiation exposure to either patients or health care workers.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 A total of 1346 subjects were treated with at least one dose of HETLIOZ, of which 139 were treated for > 26 weeks and 93 were treated for > 1 year.



 A 26-week, parallel-arm placebo-controlled study (Study 1) evaluated HETLIOZ (n=42) compared to placebo (n=42) in patients with Non-24. A randomized-withdrawal, placebo- controlled study of 8 weeks duration (Study 2) also evaluated HETLIOZ (n=10), compared to placebo (n=10), in patients with Non-24.



 In placebo-controlled studies, 6% of patients exposed to HETLIOZ discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, compared with 4% of patients who received placebo.



   Table 1  shows the incidence of adverse reactions from Study 1.




  *Adverse reactions with an incidence > 5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ than on placebo are displayed.

   Diarrhea:  Diarrhea occurred frequently and was predominantly mild to moderate in severity in both the RCC and STS clinical trials. Patients should be advised how to manage mild diarrhea and to notify their healthcare provider if moderate to severe diarrhea occurs so appropriate management can be implemented to minimize its impact.



   Lipase Elevations:  In a single-arm RCC trial, increases in lipase values were observed for 27% (48/181) of patients. Elevations in lipase as an adverse reaction were reported for 4% (10/225) of patients and were Grade 3 for 6 patients and Grade 4 for 1 patient. In the RCC trials of VOTRIENT, clinical pancreatitis was observed in <1% (4/586) of patients.



   Pneumothorax:  Two of 290 patients treated with VOTRIENT and no patient on the placebo arm in the randomized RCC trial developed a pneumothorax. In the randomized trial of VOTRIENT for the treatment of STS, pneumothorax occurred in 3% (8/240) of patients treated with VOTRIENT and in no patients on the placebo arm.



   Bradycardia:  In the randomized trial of VOTRIENT for the treatment of RCC, bradycardia based on vital signs (<60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% (52/280) of patients treated with VOTRIENT and in 11% (16/144) of patients on the placebo arm. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% (7/290) of patients treated with VOTRIENT compared with <1% (1/145) of patients treated with placebo. In the randomized trial of VOTRIENT for the treatment of STS, bradycardia based on vital signs (<60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% (45/238) of patients treated with VOTRIENT and in 4% (5/121) of patients on the placebo arm. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% (4/240) of patients treated with VOTRIENT compared with <1% (1/123) of patients treated with placebo.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VOTRIENT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   5.1 Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Impairment



  In clinical trials with VOTRIENT, hepatotoxicity, manifested as increases in serum transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin, was observed. This hepatotoxicity can be severe and fatal. Patients older than 65 years are at greater risk for hepatotoxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]  .  Transaminase elevations occur early in the course of treatment (92.5% of all transaminase elevations of any grade occurred in the first 18 weeks) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .



 In the randomized RCC trial, ALT >3 X ULN was reported in 18% and 3% of the groups receiving VOTRIENT and placebo, respectively. ALT >10 X ULN was reported in 4% of patients who received VOTRIENT and in <1% of patients who received placebo. Concurrent elevation in ALT >3 X ULN and bilirubin >2 X ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase >3 X ULN occurred in 2% (5/290) of patients on VOTRIENT and 1% (2/145) on placebo.



 In the randomized STS trial, ALT >3 X ULN was reported in 18% and 5% of the groups receiving VOTRIENT and placebo, respectively. ALT >8 X ULN was reported in 5% and 2% of the groups receiving VOTRIENT and placebo, respectively. Concurrent elevation in ALT >3 X ULN and bilirubin >2 X ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase >3 X ULN occurred in 2% (4/240) of patients on VOTRIENT and <1% (1/123) on placebo.



 Two-tenths percent of the patients (2/977) from trials that supported the RCC indication died with disease progression and hepatic failure and 0.4% of patients (1/240) in the randomized STS trial died of hepatic failure.



 *    Monitor serum liver tests before initiation of treatment with VOTRIENT and at Weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9. Thereafter, monitor at Month 3 and at Month 4, and as clinically indicated. Periodic monitoring should then continue after Month 4. 
 *    Patients with isolated ALT elevations between 3 X ULN and 8 X ULN may be continued on VOTRIENT with weekly monitoring of liver function until ALT returns to Grade 1 or baseline. 
 *    Patients with isolated ALT elevations of >8 X ULN should have VOTRIENT interrupted until they return to Grade 1 or baseline. If the potential benefit for reinitiating treatment with VOTRIENT is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then reintroduce VOTRIENT at a reduced dose of no more than 400 mg once daily and measure serum liver tests weekly for 8 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Following reintroduction of VOTRIENT, if ALT elevations >3 X ULN recur, then VOTRIENT should be permanently discontinued. 
 *    If ALT elevations >3 X ULN occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations >2 X ULN, VOTRIENT should be permanently discontinued. Patients should be monitored until resolution. VOTRIENT is a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert's syndrome [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia, known Gilbert's syndrome, and elevation in ALT >3 X ULN should be managed as per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations. 
    Concomitant use of VOTRIENT and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations and should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]  . Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and VOTRIENT.
 

 In patients with pre-existing moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose of VOTRIENT should be reduced or alternatives to VOTRIENT should be considered. Treatment with VOTRIENT is not recommended in patients with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment, defined as total bilirubin >3 X ULN with any level of ALT [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .



    5.2 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes



  In the RCC trials of VOTRIENT, QT prolongation (>=500 msec) was identified on routine electrocardiogram monitoring in 2% (11/558) of patients. Torsades de pointes occurred in <1% (2/977) of patients who received VOTRIENT in the monotherapy trials.



 In the randomized RCC and STS trials, 1% (3/290) of patients and 0.4% (1/240) of patients, respectively, who received VOTRIENT had post-baseline values between 500 to 549 msec. Post-baseline QT data were only collected in the STS trial if ECG abnormalities were reported as an adverse reaction. None of the 268 patients who received placebo on the two trials had post-baseline QTc values >=500 msec.



 VOTRIENT should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, in patients taking antiarrhythmics or other medications that may prolong QT interval, and those with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease. When using VOTRIENT, baseline and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and maintenance of electrolytes (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium) within the normal range should be performed.



    5.3 Cardiac Dysfunction



  In clinical trials with VOTRIENT, events of cardiac dysfunction such as decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and congestive heart failure have occurred. In the overall safety population for RCC (N = 586), cardiac dysfunction was observed in 0.6% (4/586) of patients without routine on-study LVEF monitoring. In a randomized RCC trial of VOTRIENT compared with sunitinib, myocardial dysfunction was defined as symptoms of cardiac dysfunction or >=15% absolute decline in LVEF compared with baseline or a decline in LVEF of >=10% compared with baseline that is also below the lower limit of normal. In patients who had baseline and follow up LVEF measurements, myocardial dysfunction occurred in 13% (47/362) of patients on VOTRIENT compared with 11% (42/369) of patients on sunitinib. Congestive heart failure occurred in 0.5% of patients on each arm.   In the randomized STS trial, myocardial dysfunction occurred in 11% (16/142) of patients on VOTRIENT compared with 5% (2/40) of patients on placebo. One percent (3/240) of patients on VOTRIENT in the STS trial had congestive heart failure which did not resolve in one patient.



 Fourteen of the 16 patients with myocardial dysfunction treated with VOTRIENT in the STS trial had concurrent hypertension which may have exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in patients at risk (e.g., those with prior anthracycline therapy) possibly by increasing cardiac afterload. Blood pressure should be monitored and managed promptly using a combination of anti-hypertensive therapy and dose modification of VOTRIENT (interruption and re-initiation at a reduced dose based on clinical judgment) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]  . Patients should be carefully monitored for clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. Baseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF is recommended in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction including previous anthracycline exposure.



    5.4 Hemorrhagic Events



  Fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.9% (5/586) in the RCC trials; there were no reports of fatal hemorrhage in the STS trials. In the randomized RCC trial, 13% (37/290) of patients treated with VOTRIENT and 5% (7/145) of patients on placebo experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events in the patients treated with VOTRIENT were hematuria (4%), epistaxis (2%), hemoptysis (2%), and rectal hemorrhage (1%). Nine of 37 patients treated with VOTRIENT who had hemorrhagic events experienced serious events including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary hemorrhage. One percent (4/290) of patients treated with VOTRIENT died from hemorrhage compared with no (0/145) patients on placebo. In the overall safety population in RCC (N = 586), cerebral/intracranial hemorrhage was observed in <1% (2/586) of patients treated with VOTRIENT.



 In the randomized STS trial, 22% (53/240) of patients treated with VOTRIENT compared with 8% (10/123) treated with placebo experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (8%), mouth hemorrhage (3%), and anal hemorrhage (2%). Grade 4 hemorrhagic events in the STS population occurred in 1% (3/240) of patients and included intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and peritoneal hemorrhage.



 VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients who have a history of hemoptysis, cerebral hemorrhage, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months and should not be used in those patients.



    5.5 Arterial Thromboembolic Events



  Fatal arterial thromboembolic events were observed in 0.3% (2/586) of patients in the RCC trials and in no patients in the STS trials. In the randomized RCC trial, 2% (5/290) of patients receiving VOTRIENT experienced myocardial infarction or ischemia, 0.3% (1/290) had a cerebrovascular accident, and 1% (4/290) had an event of transient ischemic attack. In the randomized STS trial, 2% (4/240) of patients receiving VOTRIENT experienced a myocardial infarction or ischemia, 0.4% (1/240) had a cerebrovascular accident and there were no incidents of transient ischemic attack. No arterial thromboembolic events were reported in patients who received placebo in either trial. VOTRIENT should be used with caution in patients who are at increased risk for these events or who have had a history of these events. VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months and should not be used in those patients.



    5.6 Venous Thromboembolic Events



  In RCC and STS trials of VOTRIENT, venous thromboembolic events (VTE) including venous thrombosis and fatal pulmonary embolus (PE) have occurred. In the randomized STS trial, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 5% of patients treated with VOTRIENT compared with 2% with placebo. In the randomized RCC trial, the rate was 1% in both arms. Fatal pulmonary embolus occurred in 1% (2/240) of STS patients receiving VOTRIENT and in no patients receiving placebo. There were no fatal pulmonary emboli in the RCC trial. Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE.



    5.7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy



  Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), has been reported in clinical trials of VOTRIENT as monotherapy, in combination with bevacizumab, and in combination with topotecan. VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Six of the 7 TMA cases occurred within 90 days of the initiation of VOTRIENT. Improvement of TMA was observed after treatment was discontinued. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TMA. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients developing TMA. Manage as clinically indicated.



    5.8 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula



  In the RCC and STS trials, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in 0.9% (5/586) of patients and 1% (4/382) of patients receiving VOTRIENT, respectively. Fatal perforations occurred in 0.3% (2/586) of these patients in the RCC trials and in 0.3% (1/382) of these patients in the STS trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula.



    5.9 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis



   ILD/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, has been reported in association with VOTRIENT. In clinical trials, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with VOTRIENT.  



  Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis and discontinue VOTRIENT in patients developing ILD or pneumonitis.  



    5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome



  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been reported in patients receiving VOTRIENT and may be fatal.



 RPLS is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. The diagnosis of RPLS is optimally confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients developing RPLS.



    5.11 Hypertension



  In clinical trials, hypertension (systolic blood pressure >=150 or diastolic blood pressure >=100 mm Hg) and hypertensive crisis were observed in patients treated with VOTRIENT. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating VOTRIENT. Hypertension occurs early in the course of treatment (40% of cases occurred by Day 9 and 90% of cases occurred in the first 18 weeks). Blood pressure should be monitored early after starting treatment (no longer than one week) and frequently thereafter to ensure blood pressure control. Approximately 40% of patients who received VOTRIENT experienced hypertension. Grade 3 hypertension was reported in 4% to 7% of patients receiving VOTRIENT [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .



 Increased blood pressure should be treated promptly with standard anti-hypertensive therapy and dose reduction or interruption of VOTRIENT as clinically warranted. VOTRIENT should be discontinued if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis or if hypertension is severe and persistent despite anti-hypertensive therapy and dose reduction. Approximately 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of VOTRIENT because of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .



    5.12 Wound Healing



  No formal trials on the effect of VOTRIENT on wound healing have been conducted. Since vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors such as pazopanib may impair wound healing, treatment with VOTRIENT should be stopped at least 7 days prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume VOTRIENT after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. VOTRIENT should be discontinued in patients with wound dehiscence.



    5.13 Hypothyroidism



  Hypothyroidism, confirmed based on a simultaneous rise of TSH and decline of T4, was reported in 7% (19/290) of patients treated with VOTRIENT in the randomized RCC trial and in 5% (11/240) of patients treated with VOTRIENT in the randomized STS trial. No patients on the placebo arm of either trial had hypothyroidism. In RCC and STS trials of VOTRIENT, hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse reaction in 4% (26/586) and 5% (20/382) of patients, respectively. Proactive monitoring of thyroid function tests is recommended.



    5.14 Proteinuria



  In the randomized RCC trial, proteinuria was reported as an adverse reaction in 9% (27/290) of patients receiving VOTRIENT and in no patients receiving placebo. In 2 patients, proteinuria led to discontinuation of treatment with VOTRIENT. In the randomized STS trial, proteinuria was reported as an adverse reaction in 1% (2/240) of patients, and nephrotic syndrome was reported in 1 patient treated with VOTRIENT compared with none in patients receiving placebo. Treatment was withdrawn in the patient with nephrotic syndrome.



 Baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment is recommended with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Interrupt VOTRIENT and dose reduce for 24-hour urine protein >=3 grams; discontinue VOTRIENT for repeat episodes despite dose reductions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .



    5.15 Infection



  Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), including some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. Institute appropriate anti-infective therapy promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of VOTRIENT for serious infections.



    5.16 Increased Toxicity with Other Cancer Therapy



  VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Clinical trials of VOTRIENT in combination with pemetrexed and lapatinib were terminated early due to concerns over increased toxicity and mortality. The fatal toxicities observed included pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and sudden death. A safe and effective combination dose has not been established with these regimens.



    5.17 Increased Toxicity in Developing Organs



  The safety and effectiveness of VOTRIENT in pediatric patients have not been established. VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Based on its mechanism of action, pazopanib may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation during early post-natal development. Administration of pazopanib to juvenile rats less than 21 days old resulted in toxicity to the lungs, liver, heart, and kidney and in death at doses significantly lower than the clinically recommended dose or doses tolerated in older animals. VOTRIENT may potentially cause serious adverse effects on organ development in pediatric patients, particularly in patients younger than 2 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]  .



    5.18 Pregnancy



  VOTRIENT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on its mechanism of action, VOTRIENT is expected to result in adverse reproductive effects. In pre-clinical studies in rats and rabbits, pazopanib was teratogenic, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and abortifacient.



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of VOTRIENT in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while taking VOTRIENT [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Myelofibrosis

  The safety of Jakafi was assessed in 617 patients in six clinical studies with a median duration of follow-up of 10.9 months, including 301 patients with myelofibrosis in two Phase 3 studies.



 In these two Phase 3 studies, patients had a median duration of exposure to Jakafi of 9.5 months (range 0.5 to 17 months), with 89% of patients treated for more than 6 months and 25% treated for more than 12 months. One hundred and eleven (111) patients started treatment at 15 mg twice daily and 190 patients started at 20 mg twice daily. In patients starting treatment with 15 mg twice daily (pretreatment platelet counts of 100 to 200 X 10  9  /L) and 20 mg twice daily (pretreatment platelet counts greater than 200 X 10  9  /L), 65% and 25% of patients, respectively, required a dose reduction below the starting dose within the first 8 weeks of therapy.



 In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of Jakafi, among the 155 patients treated with Jakafi, the most frequent adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anemia [  see   Table 11    ]. Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia are dose related effects. The three most frequent non-hematologic adverse reactions were bruising, dizziness and headache [  see  Table 10    ].



 Discontinuation for adverse events, regardless of causality, was observed in 11% of patients treated with Jakafi and 11% of patients treated with placebo.



   Table 10  presents the most common adverse reactions occurring in patients who received Jakafi in the double-blind, placebo-controlled study during randomized treatment.

        Description of Selected Adverse Drug Reactions  
 

   Anemia  



 In the two Phase 3 clinical studies, median time to onset of first CTCAE Grade 2 or higher anemia was approximately 6 weeks. One patient (<1%) discontinued treatment because of anemia. In patients receiving Jakafi, mean decreases in hemoglobin reached a nadir of approximately 1.5 to 2.0 g/dL below baseline after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy and then gradually recovered to reach a new steady state that was approximately 1.0 g/dL below baseline. This pattern was observed in patients regardless of whether they had received transfusions during therapy.



 In the randomized, placebo-controlled study, 60% of patients treated with Jakafi and 38% of patients receiving placebo received red blood cell transfusions during randomized treatment. Among transfused patients, the median number of units transfused per month was 1.2 in patients treated with Jakafi and 1.7 in placebo treated patients.



   Thrombocytopenia  



 In the two Phase 3 clinical studies, in patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to onset was approximately 8 weeks. Thrombocytopenia was generally reversible with dose reduction or dose interruption. The median time to recovery of platelet counts above 50 X 10  9  /L was 14 days. Platelet transfusions were administered to 5% of patients receiving Jakafi and to 4% of patients receiving control regimens. Discontinuation of treatment because of thrombocytopenia occurred in <1% of patients receiving Jakafi and <1% of patients receiving control regimens. Patients with a platelet count of 100 X 10  9  /L to 200 X 10  9  /L before starting Jakafi had a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia compared to patients with a platelet count greater than 200 X 10  9  /L (17% versus 7%).



   Neutropenia  



 In the two Phase 3 clinical studies, 1% of patients reduced or stopped Jakafi because of neutropenia.



   Table 11  provides the frequency and severity of clinical hematology abnormalities reported for patients receiving treatment with Jakafi or placebo in the placebo-controlled study.

        Additional Data from the Placebo-controlled Study  
 

 25% of patients treated with Jakafi and 7% of patients treated with placebo developed newly occurring or worsening Grade 1 abnormalities in alanine transaminase (ALT). The incidence of greater than or equal to Grade 2 elevations was 2% for Jakafi with 1% Grade 3 and no Grade 4 ALT elevations.



 17% of patients treated with Jakafi and 6% of patients treated with placebo developed newly occurring or worsening Grade 1 abnormalities in aspartate transaminase (AST). The incidence of Grade 2 AST elevations was <1% for Jakafi with no Grade 3 or 4 AST elevations.



 17% of patients treated with Jakafi and <1% of patients treated with placebo developed newly occurring or worsening Grade 1 elevations in cholesterol. The incidence of Grade 2 cholesterol elevations was <1% for Jakafi with no Grade 3 or 4 cholesterol elevations.



   6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Polycythemia Vera

  In a randomized, open-label, active-controlled study, 110 patients with polycythemia vera resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea received Jakafi and 111 patients received best available therapy  [see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )]  . The most frequent adverse drug reaction was anemia.  Table 12  presents the most frequent non-hematologic treatment emergent adverse events occurring up to Week 32.



 Discontinuation for adverse events, regardless of causality, was observed in 4% of patients treated with Jakafi.

JAKAFI,warnings and precautions,"    5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Thrombocytopenia, Anemia and Neutropenia: Manage by dose reduction, or interruption, or transfusion. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Risk of Infection: Assess patients for signs and symptoms of infection and initiate appropriate treatment promptly. Serious infections should have resolved before starting therapy with Jakafi. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Symptom Exacerbation Following Interruption or Discontinuation: Manage with supportive care and consider resuming treatment with Jakafi. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Risk of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Thrombocytopenia, Anemia and Neutropenia



  Treatment with Jakafi can cause thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia. [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )  ].



 Manage thrombocytopenia by reducing the dose or temporarily interrupting Jakafi. Platelet transfusions may be necessary [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1.1  ), and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



 Patients developing anemia may require blood transfusions and/or dose modifications of Jakafi.



 Severe neutropenia (ANC less than 0.5 X 10  9  /L) was generally reversible by withholding Jakafi until recovery [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



 Perform a pre-treatment complete blood count (CBC) and monitor CBCs every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized, and then as clinically indicated. [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1.1  ), and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



     5.2 Risk of Infection  



   Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections have occurred. Delay starting therapy with Jakafi until active serious infections have resolved. Observe patients receiving Jakafi for signs and symptoms of infection and manage promptly.  



  Tuberculosis  



  Tuberculosis infection has been reported in patients receiving Jakafi. Observe patients receiving Jakafi for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis and manage promptly.  



  Prior to initiating Jakafi, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors, and those at higher risk should be tested for latent infection. Risk factors include, but are not limited to, prior residence in or travel to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, close contact with a person with active tuberculosis, and a history of active or latent tuberculosis where an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.  



  For patients with evidence of active or latent tuberculosis, consult a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis before starting Jakafi. The decision to continue Jakafi during treatment of active tuberculosis should be based on the overall risk-benefit determination.  



  PML  



  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has occurred with ruxolitinib treatment for myelofibrosis. If PML is suspected, stop Jakafi and evaluate.  



  Herpes Zoster  



  Advise patients about early signs and symptoms of herpes zoster and to seek treatment as early as possible if suspected [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].  



     5.3 Symptom Exacerbation Following Interruption or Discontinuation of Treatment with Jakafi  



   Following discontinuation of Jakafi, symptoms from myeloproliferative neoplasms may return to pretreatment levels over a period of approximately one week. Some patients with myelofibrosis have experienced one or more of the following adverse events after discontinuing Jakafi: fever, respiratory distress, hypotension, DIC, or multi-organ failure. If one or more of these occur after discontinuation of, or while tapering the dose of Jakafi, evaluate for and treat any intercurrent illness and consider restarting or increasing the dose of Jakafi. Instruct patients not to interrupt or discontinue Jakafi therapy without consulting their physician. When discontinuing or interrupting therapy with Jakafi for reasons other than thrombocytopenia or neutropenia [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )  ], consider tapering the dose of Jakafi gradually rather than discontinuing abruptly.  



     5.4 Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer  



   Non-melanoma skin cancers including basal cell, squamous cell, and Merkel cell carcinoma have occurred in patients treated with Jakafi. Perform periodic skin examinations.

AKYNZEO,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=3% and greater than palonosetron) are headache, asthenia, dyspepsia, fatigue, constipation and erythema (  6.1  )   



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact EISAI at 1-888-422-4743 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or      www.fda.gov/medwatch      .        



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The overall safety of AKYNZEO was evaluated in 1538 cancer patients and healthy volunteers in clinical trials. The data described below reflect exposure to AKYNZEO in 1169 cancer patients, receiving at least one cycle of cancer chemotherapy in 3 active-controlled trials  [    see Clinical Studies (14)    ]  , including 782 exposed to AKYNZEO for at least 4 cycles and 321 exposed for at least 6 cycles, up to a maximum of 12 cycles of chemotherapy. The median age was 55, 79% were female, 83% were White, 13% were Asian, and 4% were Hispanic. All patients received a single oral dose of AKYNZEO 1 hour prior to the start of each chemotherapy cycle. In all studies, dexamethasone was co-administered with AKYNZEO  [see Clinical Studies (14), Table 5 and Table 7].  



   Cisplatin Based Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy  



 In a single-cycle study of patients receiving cisplatin-based highly emetogenic chemotherapy, 136 patients were treated with AKYNZEO. Table 1 shows adverse reactions defined as adverse events reported at an incidence of at least 3% and for which the AKYNZEO rate exceeded palonosetron alone.

           Anthracyclines and Cyclophosphamide Based Chemotherapy  
 

 In a study of patients receiving anthracycline and cyclophosphamide based chemotherapy, 725 patients were treated with AKYNZEO during Cycle 1, and 635 of these patients continued for up to 8 cycles in a multiple-cycle extension. Table 2 shows adverse reactions defined as adverse events reported at an incidence of at least 3% and for which the AKYNZEO rate exceeded palonosetron alone during Cycle 1. The adverse reaction profile in subsequent cycles was similar to that observed in Cycle 1.

   5.1 Hypersensitivity



  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT3receptor antagonists.



    5.2 Serotonin Syndrome



  The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.  



 Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).  Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of AKYNZEO and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue AKYNZEO and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if AKYNZEO is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (   7   ), Patient Counseling Information (   17   )]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of VIEKIRA PAK cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety assessment was based on data from six Phase 3 clinical trials in more than 2,000 subjects who received VIEKIRA PAK with or without ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks.



   VIEKIRA PAK with Ribavirin in Placebo-Controlled Trials  



 The safety of VIEKIRA PAK in combination with ribavirin was assessed in 770 subjects with chronic HCV infection in two placebo-controlled trials (SAPPHIRE-I and -II)  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  ,  14.2  )]  . Adverse reactions that occurred more often in subjects treated with VIEKIRA PAK in combination with ribavirin compared to placebo were fatigue, nausea, pruritus, other skin reactions, insomnia, and asthenia (see  Table 3  ). The majority of the adverse reactions were mild in severity. Two percent of subjects experienced a serious adverse event (SAE). The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was less than 1%.

        VIEKIRA PAK with and without Ribavirin in Regimen-Controlled Trials  
 

 VIEKIRA PAK with and without ribavirin was assessed in 401 and 509 subjects with chronic HCV infection, respectively, in three clinical trials (PEARL-II, PEARL-III and PEARL-IV)  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  ,  14.2  )]  . Pruritus, nausea, insomnia, and asthenia were identified as adverse events occurring more often in subjects treated with VIEKIRA PAK in combination with ribavirin (see  Table 4  ). The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was less than 1% for both VIEKIRA PAK in combination with ribavirin and VIEKIRA PAK alone.

        VIEKIRA PAK with Ribavirin in Subjects with Compensated Cirrhosis  
 

 VIEKIRA PAK with ribavirin was assessed in 380 subjects with compensated cirrhosis who were treated for 12 (n=208) or 24 (n=172) weeks duration (TURQUOISE-II)  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  ,  14.3  )]  . The type and severity of adverse events in subjects with compensated cirrhosis was comparable to non-cirrhotic subjects in other phase 3 trials. Fatigue, skin reactions and dyspnea occurred at least 5% more often in subjects treated for 24 weeks. The majority of adverse events occurred during the first 12 weeks of dosing in both treatment arms. Most of the adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. The proportion of subjects treated with VIEKIRA PAK for 12 and 24 weeks with SAEs was 6% and 5%, respectively and 2% of subjects permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events in each treatment arm.



   Skin Reactions  



 In PEARL-II, -III and -IV, 7% of subjects receiving VIEKIRA PAK alone and 10% of subjects receiving VIEKIRA PAK with ribavirin reported rash-related events. In SAPPHIRE-I and -II 16% of subjects receiving VIEKIRA PAK with ribavirin and 9% of subjects receiving placebo reported skin reactions. In TURQUOISE-II, 18% and 24% of subjects receiving VIEKIRA PAK with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks reported skin reactions. The majority of events were graded as mild in severity. There were no serious events or severe cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), erythema multiforme (EM) or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).



   Laboratory Abnormalities  



   Serum ALT Elevations  



 Approximately 1% of subjects treated with VIEKIRA PAK experienced post-baseline serum ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) after starting treatment. The incidence increased to 25% (4/16) among women taking a concomitant ethinyl estradiol containing medication  [see Contraindications (  4  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  . The incidence of clinically relevant ALT elevations among women using estrogens other than ethinyl estradiol, such as estradiol and conjugated estrogens used in hormone replacement therapy was 3% (2/59).



 ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic, generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment (mean time 20 days, range 8-57 days) and most resolved with ongoing therapy. The majority of these ALT elevations were assessed as drug-related liver injury. Elevations in ALT were generally not associated with bilirubin elevations. Cirrhosis was not a risk factor for elevated ALT  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .



   Serum Bilirubin Elevations  



 Post-baseline elevations in bilirubin at least 2 x ULN were observed in 15% of subjects receiving VIEKIRA PAK with ribavirin compared to 2% in those receiving VIEKIRA PAK alone. These bilirubin increases were predominately indirect and related to the inhibition of the bilirubin transporters OATP1B1/1B3 by paritaprevir and ribavirin-induced hemolysis. Bilirubin elevations occurred after initiation of treatment, peaked by study Week 1, and generally resolved with ongoing therapy. Bilirubin elevations were not associated with serum ALT elevations.



   Anemia/Decreased Hemoglobin  



 Across all Phase 3 studies, the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin levels in subjects treated with VIEKIRA PAK in combination with ribavirin was -2.4 g/dL and the mean change in subjects treated with VIEKIRA PAK alone was -0.5 g/dL. Decreases in hemoglobin levels occurred early in treatment (Week 1-2) with further reductions through Week 3. Hemoglobin values remained low during the remainder of treatment and returned towards baseline levels by post-treatment Week 4. Less than 1% of subjects treated with VIEKIRA PAK with ribavirin had hemoglobin levels decrease to less than 8.0 g/dL during treatment. Seven percent of subjects treated with VIEKIRA PAK in combination with ribavirin underwent a ribavirin dose reduction due to a decrease in hemoglobin levels; three subjects received a blood transfusion and five required erythropoietin. One patient discontinued therapy due to anemia. No subjects treated with VIEKIRA PAK alone had a hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL.



   VIEKIRA PAK in HCV/HIV-1 Co-infected Subjects  



 VIEKIRA PAK with ribavirin was assessed in 63 subjects with HCV/HIV-1 co-infection who were on stable antiretroviral therapy. The most common adverse events occurring in at least 10% of subjects were fatigue (48%), insomnia (19%), nausea (17%), headache (16%), pruritus (13%), cough (11%), irritability (10%), and ocular icterus (10%).



 Elevations in total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN (mostly indirect) occurred in 34 (54%) subjects. Fifteen of these subjects were also receiving atazanavir at the time of bilirubin elevation and nine also had adverse events of ocular icterus, jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia. None of the subjects with hyperbilirubinemia had concomitant elevations of aminotransferases  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ), Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) and Clinical Studies (  14.6  )]  . No subject experienced a grade 3 ALT elevation.



 Seven subjects (11%) had at least one post-baseline hemoglobin value of less than 10 g/dL, and six of these subjects had a ribavirin dose modification; no subject in this small cohort required a blood transfusion or erythropoietin.



 Median declines in CD4+ T-cell counts of 47 cells/mm  3  and 62 cells/mm  3  were observed at the end of 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively, and most returned to baseline levels post-treatment. Two subjects had CD4+ T-cell counts decrease to less than 200 cells/mm  3  during treatment without a decrease in CD4%. No subject experienced an AIDS-related opportunistic infection.



   VIEKIRA PAK in Selected Liver Transplant Recipients  



 VIEKIRA PAK with ribavirin was assessed in 34 post-liver transplant subjects with recurrent HCV infection. Adverse events occurring in more than 20% of subjects included fatigue 50%, headache 44%, cough 32%, diarrhea 26%, insomnia 26%, asthenia 24%, nausea 24%, muscle spasms 21% and rash 21%. Ten subjects (29%) had at least one post-baseline hemoglobin value of less than 10 g/dL. Ten subjects underwent a ribavirin dose modification due to decrease in hemoglobin and 3% (1/34) had an interruption of ribavirin. Five subjects received erythropoietin, all of whom initiated ribavirin at the starting dose of 1000 to 1200 mg daily. No subject received a blood transfusion  [see Clinical Studies (  14.5  )]  .

VIEKIRA,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   ALT Elevations : Discontinue ethinyl estradiol-containing medications prior to starting VIEKIRA PAK (alternative contraceptive methods are recommended). Perform hepatic laboratory testing on all patients during the first 4 weeks of treatment. For ALT elevations on VIEKIRA PAK, monitor closely and follow recommendations in full prescribing information. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Risks Associated With Ribavirin Combination Treatment : If VIEKIRA PAK is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin also apply to this combination regimen. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Drug Interactions : The concomitant use of VIEKIRA PAK and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of VIEKIRA PAK. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Increased Risk of ALT Elevations



  During clinical trials with VIEKIRA PAK with or without ribavirin, elevations of ALT to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in approximately 1% of all subjects [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic, occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment, and declined within two to eight weeks of onset with continued dosing of VIEKIRA PAK with or without ribavirin.



 These ALT elevations were significantly more frequent in female subjects who were using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as combined oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches or contraceptive vaginal rings. Ethinyl estradiol-containing medications must be discontinued prior to starting therapy with VIEKIRA PAK [see Contraindications (  4  )]  . Alternative methods of contraception (e.g, progestin only contraception or non-hormonal methods) are recommended during VIEKIRA PAK therapy. Ethinyl estradiol-containing medications can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with VIEKIRA PAK.



 Women using estrogens other than ethinyl estradiol, such as estradiol and conjugated estrogens used in hormone replacement therapy had a rate of ALT elevation similar to those not receiving any estrogens; however, due to the limited number of subjects taking these other estrogens, caution is warranted for co-administration with VIEKIRA PAK [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 Hepatic laboratory testing should be performed during the first 4 weeks of starting treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter. If ALT is found to be elevated above baseline levels, it should be repeated and monitored closely:



 *  Patients should be instructed to consult their health care professional without delay if they have onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discolored feces. 
 *  Consider discontinuing VIEKIRA PAK if ALT levels remain persistently greater than 10 times the ULN. 
 *  Discontinue VIEKIRA PAK if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or INR. 
       5.2 Risks Associated With Ribavirin Combination Treatment
 

  If VIEKIRA PAK is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin, in particular the pregnancy avoidance warning, apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a full list of the warnings and precautions for ribavirin.



    5.3 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions



  The concomitant use of VIEKIRA PAK and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to:



 *  Loss of therapeutic effect of VIEKIRA PAK and possible development of resistance 
 *  Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs or components of VIEKIRA PAK. 
    See Table 5 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during VIEKIRA PAK therapy; review concomitant medications during VIEKIRA PAK therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs [see Contraindications (  4  ) and Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .
 

    5.4 Risk of HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor Drug Resistance in HCV/HIV-1 Co-infected Patients



  The ritonavir component of VIEKIRA PAK is also an HIV-1 protease inhibitor and can select for HIV-1 protease inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions. Any HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients treated with VIEKIRA PAK should also be on a suppressive antiretroviral drug regimen to reduce the risk of HIV-1 protease inhibitor drug resistance.

 The adverse reactions described in  Table 1  were identified in 804 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in Study 1. Patients were randomized to receive either PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. The median duration of study treatment was 18.1 months for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 11.8 months for patients in the placebo-treated group. No dose adjustment was permitted for PERJETA or trastuzumab. The rates of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of all study therapy were 6.1% for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 5.3% for patients in the placebo-treated group. Adverse events led to discontinuation of docetaxel alone in 23.6% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 23.2% of patients in the placebo-treated group.  Table 1  reports the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group. The safety profile of PERJETA remained unchanged with an additional 2.75 years of follow-up (median total follow-up of 50 months) in Study 1.



 The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) seen with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common NCI - CTCAE v3.0 Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, asthenia, and fatigue. An increased incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed for Asian patients in both treatment arms compared with patients of other races and from other geographic regions. Among Asian patients, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in the pertuzumab-treated group (26%) compared with the placebo-treated group (12%).

             The following clinically relevant adverse reactions were reported in < 10% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group in Study 1:  
 

   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  Paronychia (7.1% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 3.5% in the placebo-treated group)



   Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:  Pleural effusion (5.2% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 5.8% in the placebo-treated group)



   Cardiac disorders:  Left ventricular dysfunction (4.4% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 8.3% in the placebo-treated group) including symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (CHF) (1.0% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 1.8% in the placebo-treated group)



   Immune system disorders:  Hypersensitivity (10.1% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 8.6% in placebo-treated group)



     Adverse Reactions Reported in Patients Receiving PERJETA and Trastuzumab after Discontinuation of Docetaxel  



 In Study 1, adverse reactions were reported less frequently after discontinuation of docetaxel treatment. All adverse reactions in the PERJETA and trastuzumab treatment group occurred in < 10% of patients with the exception of diarrhea (19.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (12.8%), rash (11.7%), headache (11.4%), and fatigue (11.1%).



     Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer (Study 2)  



 In Study 2, the most common adverse reactions seen with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel administered for 4 cycles were similar to those seen in the PERJETA-treated group in Study 1. The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhea, and nausea. The most common NCI - CTCAE v3.0 Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and diarrhea. In this group, one patient permanently discontinued neoadjuvant treatment due to an adverse event.  Table 2  reports the adverse reactions that occurred in patients who received neoadjuvant treatment with PERJETA for breast cancer in Study 2.

     Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer (Study 3)  



 In Study 3, when PERJETA was administered in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for 3 cycles following 3 cycles of FEC, the most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, neutropenia, vomiting, and fatigue. The most common NCI-CTCAE (version 3) Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, left ventricular dysfunction, anemia, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting.



 Similarly, when PERJETA was administered in combination with docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH) for 6 cycles, the most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The most common NCI-CTCAE (version 3) Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, leukopenia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, fatigue, ALT increased, hypokalemia, and hypersensitivity.



 The rates of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of any component of neoadjuvant treatment were 6.7% for patients receiving PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC and 7.9% for patients receiving PERJETA in combination with TCH.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for an immune response to PERJETA.



 Patients in Study 1 were tested at multiple time-points for antibodies to PERJETA. Approximately 2.8% (11/386) of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 6.2% (23/372) of patients in the placebo-treated group tested positive for anti-PERJETA antibodies. Of these 34 patients, none experienced anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions that were clearly related to the anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA). The presence of pertuzumab in patient serum at the levels expected at the time of ATA sampling can interfere with the ability of this assay to detect anti-pertuzumab antibodies. In addition, the assay may be detecting antibodies to trastuzumab. As a result, data may not accurately reflect the true incidence of anti-pertuzumab antibody development.



 Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods used. Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive result in a test method may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, drug interference, concomitant medication, and the underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to PERJETA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   5.1 Left Ventricular Dysfunction



  Decreases in LVEF have been reported with drugs that block HER2 activity, including PERJETA. In Study 1, for patients with MBC, PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel was not associated with increases in the incidence of symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or decreases in LVEF compared with placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 4.4% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 8.3% of patients in the placebo-treated group. Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (congestive heart failure) occurred in 1.0% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 1.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Patients who have received prior anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the chest area may be at higher risk of decreased LVEF.



 In patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment in Study 2, the incidence of LVSD was higher in the PERJETA-treated groups compared to the trastuzumab- and docetaxel-treated group. An increased incidence of LVEF declines was observed in patients treated with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. In the overall treatment period, LVEF decline > 10% and a drop to less than 50% occurred in 1.9% of patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel as compared to 8.4% of patients treated with neoadjuvant PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Symptomatic LVSD occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with neoadjuvant PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and no patients in the other 3 arms. LVEF recovered to >= 50% in all patients.



 In patients receiving neoadjuvant PERJETA in Study 3, in the overall treatment period, LVEF decline > 10% and a drop to less than 50% occurred in 6.9% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel, 16.0% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, and 10.5% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH. Symptomatic LVSD occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, 1.3% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH, and none of the patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel. LVEF recovered to >= 50% in all but one patient.



 PERJETA has not been studied in patients with a pretreatment LVEF value of <= 50%, a prior history of CHF, decreases in LVEF to < 50% during prior trastuzumab therapy, or conditions that could impair left ventricular function such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or a cumulative prior anthracycline exposure to > 360 mg/m  2  of doxorubicin or its equivalent.



 Assess LVEF prior to initiation of PERJETA and at regular intervals (e.g., every three months in the metastatic setting and every six weeks in the neoadjuvant setting) during treatment to ensure that LVEF is within the institution's normal limits. If LVEF is < 45%, or is 45% to 49% with a 10% or greater absolute decrease below the pretreatment value, withhold PERJETA and trastuzumab and repeat LVEF assessment within approximately 3 weeks. Discontinue PERJETA and trastuzumab if the LVEF has not improved or has declined further, unless the benefits for the individual patient outweigh the risks [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



   PERJETA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Treatment of pregnant cynomolgus monkeys with pertuzumab resulted in oligohydramnios, delayed fetal kidney development, and embryo-fetal death. If PERJETA is administered during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug or within 7 months following the last dose of PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .  



  Verify pregnancy status prior to the initiation of PERJETA. Advise patients of the risks of embryo-fetal death and birth defects and the need for contraception during and after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they suspect they may be pregnant. If PERJETA is administered during pregnancy or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving PERJETA or within 7 months following the last dose of PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab, immediately report exposure to the Genentech Adverse Event Line at 1-888-835-2555. Encourage women who may be exposed during pregnancy or within 7 months for PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab prior to conception, to enroll in the MotHER Pregnancy Registry by contacting 1-800-690-6720 [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ].    



 Monitor patients who become pregnant during PERJETA therapy for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. The efficacy of intravenous hydration in the management of oligohydramnios due to PERJETA exposure is not known.



    5.3 Infusion-Related Reactions



  PERJETA has been associated with infusion reactions [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  An infusion reaction was defined in Study 1 as any event described as hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, acute infusion reaction, or cytokine release syndrome occurring during an infusion or on the same day as the infusion. The initial dose of PERJETA was given the day before trastuzumab and docetaxel to allow for the examination of PERJETA-associated reactions. On the first day, when only PERJETA was administered, the overall frequency of infusion reactions was 13.0% in the PERJETA-treated group and 9.8% in the placebo-treated group. Less than 1% were Grade 3 or 4. The most common infusion reactions (>= 1.0%) were pyrexia, chills, fatigue, headache, asthenia, hypersensitivity, and vomiting.



 During the second cycle when all drugs were administered on the same day, the most common infusion reactions in the PERJETA-treated group (>= 1.0%) were fatigue, dysgeusia, hypersensitivity, myalgia, and vomiting.



 In Study 2 and Study 3, PERJETA was administered on the same day as the other study treatment drugs. Infusion reactions were consistent with those observed in Study 1, with a majority of reactions being National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI - CTCAE v3.0) Grade 1 - 2.



 Observe patients closely for 60 minutes after the first infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions of PERJETA. If a significant infusion-related reaction occurs, slow or interrupt the infusion, and administer appropriate medical therapies. Monitor patients carefully until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Consider permanent discontinuation in patients with severe infusion reactions [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  



    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions/Anaphylaxis



  In Study 1, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 10.8% in the PERJETA-treated group and 9.1% in the placebo-treated group. The incidence of Grade 3 - 4 hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 2.0% in the PERJETA-treated group and 2.5% in the placebo-treated group according to NCI - CTCAE v3.0. Overall, 4 patients in PERJETA-treated group and 2 patients in the placebo-treated group experienced anaphylaxis.



 In Study 2 and Study 3, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events were consistent with those observed in Study 1. In Study 2, two patients in the PERJETA- and docetaxel-treated group experienced anaphylaxis. In Study 3, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis was highest in the PERJETA plus TCH treated group (13.2%), of which 2.6% were NCI-CTCAE (version 3) Grade 3 - 4.



 Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions. Severe hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, has been observed in clinical trials with treatment of PERJETA [see  Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)  ]  . Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use. PERJETA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pertuzumab or to any of its excipients [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.5 HER2 Testing



  Detection of HER2 protein overexpression is necessary for selection of patients appropriate for PERJETA therapy because these are the only patients studied and for whom benefit has been shown [see  Indications and Usage (1)  and  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . Patients with breast cancer were required to have evidence of HER2 overexpression defined as 3+ IHC or FISH amplification ratio >= 2.0 in the clinical studies. Only limited data were available for patients whose breast cancer was positive by FISH, but did not demonstrate protein overexpression by IHC.



 Assessment of HER2 status should be performed by laboratories using FDA-approved tests with demonstrated proficiency in the specific technology being utilized. Improper assay performance, including use of sub-optimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA in Trial 1, an uncontrolled, open-label, multiple cohort trial in which 411 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma received KEYTRUDA at either 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 6.2 months (range 1 day to 24.6 months) with a median of 10 doses (range 1 to 51). The study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range 18 to 94), 39% age 65 years or older, 60% male, 97% white, 73% with M1c disease, 8% with brain metastases, 35% with elevated LDH, 54% with prior exposure to ipilimumab, and 47% with two or more prior systemic therapies for advanced or metastatic disease.



 KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of the 411 patients. Adverse reactions, reported in at least two patients, that led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were: pneumonitis, renal failure, and pain. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse drug reactions reported in 2% or more of patients in Trial 1 were renal failure, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cellulitis.



 Table 1 presents adverse reactions identified from analyses of the 89 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every three weeks in one cohort of Trial 1. Patients had documented disease progression following treatment with ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. This cohort of Trial 1 excluded patients with severe immune-related toxicity related to ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity requiring treatment with corticosteroids or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for greater than 12 weeks; a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease; or any active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C. Of the 89 patients in this cohort, the median age was 59 years (range 18 to 88), 33% were age 65 years or older, 53% were male, 98% were white, 44% had an elevated LDH, 84% had Stage M1c disease, 8% had brain metastases, and 70% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 6.2 months (range 1 day to 15.3 months) with a median of nine doses (range 1 to 23). Fifty-one percent of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for greater than 6 months and 21% for greater than 1 year.



 KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 6% of the 89 patients. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.

           6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. Because trough levels of pembrolizumab interfere with the electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay results, a subset analysis was performed in the patients with a concentration of pembrolizumab below the drug tolerance level of the anti-product antibody assay. In this analysis, none of the 97 patients who were treated with 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-pembrolizumab antibodies.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to KEYTRUDA with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   5.1 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis



  Pneumonitis occurred in 12 (2.9%) of 411 melanoma patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 8 (1.9%) and 1 (0.2%) patients, respectively, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to development of pneumonitis was 5 months (range 0.3 weeks to 9.9 months). The median duration was 4.9 months (range 1 week to 14.4 months). Five of eight patients with Grade 2 and the one patient with Grade 3 pneumonitis required initial treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. The median initial dose of high-dose corticosteroid treatment was 63.4 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent with a median duration of treatment of 3 days (range 1 to 34) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 3 (0.7%) patients. Pneumonitis completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with Grade 2-3 pneumonitis.



 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate patients with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging and administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) pneumonitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.2 Immune-Mediated Colitis



  Colitis (including microscopic colitis) occurred in 4 (1%) of 411 patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 1 (0.2%) and 2 (0.5%) patients, respectively, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset of colitis was 6.5 months (range 2.3 to 9.8). The median duration was 2.6 months (range 0.6 weeks to 3.6 months). All three patients with Grade 2 or 3 colitis were treated with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) with a median initial dose of 70 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; the median duration of initial treatment was 7 days (range 4 to 41), followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to colitis. All four patients with colitis experienced complete resolution of the event.



 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) colitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for life-threatening (Grade 4) colitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.3 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis



  Hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis) occurred in 2 (0.5%) of 411 patients, including a Grade 4 case in 1 (0.2%) patient, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The time to onset was 22 days for the case of Grade 4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1 months. The patient with Grade 4 hepatitis permanently discontinued KEYTRUDA and was treated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) systemic corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper. Both patients with hepatitis experienced complete resolution of the event.



 Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.4 Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies



    Hypophysitis    



  Hypophysitis occurred in 2 (0.5%) of 411 patients, consisting of one Grade 2 and one Grade 4 case (0.2% each), in patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The time to onset was 1.7 months for the patient with Grade 4 hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with Grade 2 hypophysitis. Both patients were treated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper and remained on a physiologic replacement dose.  



  Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hypophysitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) hypophysitis, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) hypophysitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for life-threatening (Grade 4) hypophysitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    



     Thyroid Disorders    



  Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411 patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 2 (0.5%) and 1 (0.2%) patients, respectively, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset was 1.5 months (range 0.5 to 2.1). The median duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1). One of two patients with Grade 2 and the one patient with Grade 3 hyperthyroidism required initial treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to hyperthyroidism. All five patients with hyperthyroidism experienced complete resolution of the event.  



  Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 patients, including a Grade 3 case in 1 (0.2%) patient, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 3.5 months (range 0.7 weeks to 19 months). All but two of the patients with hypothyroidism were treated with long-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The other two patients only required short-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. No patient received corticosteroids or discontinued KEYTRUDA for management of hypothyroidism.  



  Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  



  Administer corticosteroids for Grade 3 or greater hyperthyroidism, withhold KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) hyperthyroidism, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for life-threatening (Grade 4) hyperthyroidism. Isolated hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    



     Type 1 Diabetes mellitus    



  Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia and other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA in cases of severe hyperglycemia until metabolic control is achieved [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    



    5.5 Renal Failure and Immune-Mediated Nephritis



  Nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients, consisting of one case of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis (0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one Grade 3 and one Grade 4. The time to onset of autoimmune nephritis was 11.6 months after the first dose of KEYTRUDA (5 months after the last dose) and lasted 3.2 months; this patient did not have a biopsy. Acute interstitial nephritis was confirmed by renal biopsy in two patients with Grades 3-4 renal failure. All three patients fully recovered renal function with treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper.



 Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) nephritis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3), or life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.6 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions



  Other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur.



 The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with KEYTRUDA in Trial 1: exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma.



  Across clinical studies with KEYTRUDA, the following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions have occurred: severe dermatitis including bullous pemphigoid, myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis.  



  For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Restart KEYTRUDA if the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any severe or Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    



    5.7 Infusion-Related Reactions



   Infusion-related reactions, including severe and life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritis, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .  



    5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.8)  ].

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Open-Label, Single-Arm Study  



 The safety of MYALEPT was evaluated in 48 patients with generalized lipodystrophy in a single-arm, open-label study [see    Clinical Studies (14.1)    ]. The median duration of exposure in this trial was 2.7 years with a range of 3.6 months to 10.9 years. The most frequent adverse reactions are summarized in Table 2.

 Six patients (13%) had 7 adverse reactions of hypoglycemia, 6 of which occurred in the setting of concomitant insulin use, with or without oral antihyperglycemic agents.



 Two patients (4%) had events of pancreatitis, both of whom had a medical history of pancreatitis.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Anti-metreleptin antibodies were detected in 84% (36/43) of generalized lipodystrophy patients studied in the MYALEPT trials. Total anti-metreleptin antibody titers ranged between 1:5 and 1:1,953,125. The incompleteness of the current immunogenicity database precludes understanding of the magnitude and persistence of the observed anti-drug antibody responses. Anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity associated with adverse events consistent with loss of endogenous leptin activity and/or loss of MYALEPT efficacy were observed in 6% (2/33) of the patients with generalized lipodystrophy tested. Adverse events reported in these two patients included severe infections and worsening of metabolic control (increases in HbA1cand/or triglycerides). Test for anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity in patients who develop severe infections or show signs suspicious for loss of MYALEPT efficacy during treatment. Contact Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-216-1526 for testing of clinical samples.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The immunogenicity assays utilized in clinical trials lacked sensitivity, resulting in potential underestimation of the number of samples positive for anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to metreleptin with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   5.1 Risk for Development of Antibodies that Neutralize Endogenous Leptin and/or MYALEPT



  Anti-metreleptin antibodies with in vitro  neutralizing activity to leptin associated with adverse events consistent with loss of endogenous leptin activity and/or loss of efficacy have been identified in two patients with generalized lipodystrophy treated with MYALEPT (severe infections, increases in HbA1cand triglycerides), and in three patients without lipodystrophy who received MYALEPT in clinical studies (excessive weight gain, development of glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus). The clinical implications associated with development of anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity are not well characterized at this time due to the small number of reports. Test for anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity in patients who develop severe infections or show signs suspicious for loss of MYALEPT efficacy during treatment. Contact Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-216-1526 for neutralizing antibody testing of clinical samples [see   Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ].



    5.2 Lymphoma



  Three cases of T-cell lymphoma have been reported in the MYALEPT lipodystrophy program; all three patients had acquired generalized lipodystrophy. Two of these patients were diagnosed with peripheral T-cell lymphoma while receiving MYALEPT. Both had immunodeficiency and significant hematologic abnormalities including severe bone marrow abnormalities before the start of MYALEPT treatment. A separate case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma was reported in a patient receiving MYALEPT who did not have hematological abnormalities before treatment.



 Lymphoproliferative disorders, including lymphomas, have been reported in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy not treated with MYALEPT. A causal relationship between MYALEPT treatment and the development and/or progression of lymphoma has not been established. Acquired lipodystrophies are associated with autoimmune disorders, and autoimmune disorders are associated with an increased risk of malignancies including lymphomas.



 The benefits and risks of MYALEPT treatment should be carefully considered in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy and/or those with significant hematologic abnormalities (including leukopenia, neutropenia, bone marrow abnormalities, lymphoma, and/or lymphadenopathy).



    5.3 MYALEPT REMS Program



  MYALEPT is available only through a restricted distribution program under a REMS, called the MYALEPT REMS Program, because of the risks associated with the development of anti-metreleptin antibodies that neutralize endogenous leptin and/or MYALEPT and the risk for lymphoma [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1,    5.2)    ].



 Notable requirements of the MYALEPT REMS Program include the following:



 *  Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. 
 *  Pharmacies must be certified with the program and only dispense MYALEPT after receipt of the MYALEPT REMS Prescription Authorization Form for each new prescription. 
    Further information is available at www.myaleptrems.com  or 1-855-6MYALEPT.
 

    5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues



  Dosage adjustments, including possible large reductions, of insulin or insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) may be necessary in some patients to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia [see   Dosage and Administration (2.4)    and   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Closely monitor blood glucose in patients on concomitant insulin therapy, especially those on high doses, or insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), when treating with MYALEPT.



    5.5 Autoimmunity



  Leptin plays a role in immune system homeostasis. Acquired lipodystrophies are associated with autoimmune disorders including autoimmune hepatitis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Cases of progression of autoimmune hepatitis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (associated with massive proteinuria and renal failure) were observed in some patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy treated with MYALEPT. A causal relationship between MYALEPT treatment and the development and/or progression of autoimmune disease has not been established. The potential benefits and risks of MYALEPT treatment should be carefully considered in patients with autoimmune disease.



    5.6 Hypersensitivity



  There have been reports of generalized hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis, urticaria or generalized rash) in patients taking MYALEPT. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, instruct the patient to promptly seek medical advice regarding discontinuation of MYALEPT.



    5.7 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity



  MYALEPT contains benzyl alcohol when reconstituted with BWFI. MYALEPT contains no preservative when reconstituted with sterile Water for Injection (WFI). Preservative-free WFI is recommended for use in neonates and infants. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients, particularly in neonates and premature infants [see   Use in Specific Populations (8.4)    ].

   EXCERPT:    *  Adverse reactions reported in >=5% of patients treated with TRADJENTA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo included nasopharyngitis  (6.1)   
 *  Hypoglycemia was more commonly reported in patients treated with the combination of TRADJENTA and sulfonylurea compared with those treated with the combination of placebo and sulfonylurea  (6.1)

  6.1  Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety evaluation of TRADJENTA 5 mg once daily in patients with type 2 diabetes is based on 14 placebo-controlled trials, 1 active-controlled study, and one study in patients with severe renal impairment. In the 14 placebo-controlled studies, a total of 3625 patients were randomized and treated with TRADJENTA 5 mg daily and 2176 with placebo. The mean exposure in patients treated with TRADJENTA across studies was 29.6 weeks. The maximum follow-up was 78 weeks.



 TRADJENTA 5 mg once daily was studied as monotherapy in three placebo-controlled trials of 18 and 24 weeks' duration and in five additional placebo-controlled studies lasting <=18 weeks. The use of TRADJENTA in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents was studied in six placebo-controlled trials: two with metformin (12 and 24 weeks' treatment duration); one with a sulfonylurea (18 weeks' treatment duration); one with metformin and sulfonylurea (24 weeks' treatment duration); one with pioglitazone (24 weeks' treatment duration); and one with insulin (primary endpoint at 24 weeks).



 In a pooled dataset of 14 placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving TRADJENTA (n = 3625) and more commonly than in patients given placebo (n = 2176), are shown in Table 1. The overall incidence of adverse events with TRADJENTA were similar to placebo.



 Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in >=2% of Patients Treated with TRADJENTA and Greater than Placebo in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of TRADJENTA Monotherapy or Combination Therapy 
                    Number (%) of Patients     
   TRADJENTA 5 mgn = 3625      Placebon = 2176     
 Nasopharyngitis  254 (7.0)        132 (6.1)         
 Diarrhea         119 (3.3)        65 (3.0)          
 Cough            76 (2.1)         30 (1.4)          
      Rates for other adverse reactions for TRADJENTA 5 mg vs placebo when TRADJENTA was used in combination with specific anti-diabetic agents were: urinary tract infection (3.1% vs 0%) and hypertriglyceridemia (2.4% vs 0%) when TRADJENTA was used as add-on to sulfonylurea; hyperlipidemia (2.7% vs 0.8%) and weight increased (2.3% vs 0.8%) when TRADJENTA was used as add-on to pioglitazone; and constipation (2.1% vs 1%) when TRADJENTA was used as add-on to basal insulin therapy.
 

 Following 104 weeks' treatment in a controlled study comparing TRADJENTA with glimepiride in which all patients were also receiving metformin, adverse reactions reported in >=5% of patients treated with TRADJENTA (n = 776) and more frequently than in patients treated with a sulfonylurea (n = 775) were back pain (9.1% vs 8.4%), arthralgia (8.1% vs 6.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.0% vs 7.6%), headache (6.4% vs 5.2%), cough (6.1% vs 4.9%), and pain in extremity (5.3% vs 3.9%).



 Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatment of TRADJENTA were hypersensitivity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, localized skin exfoliation, or bronchial hyperreactivity), and myalgia. In the clinical trial program, pancreatitis was reported in 15.2 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with TRADJENTA compared with 3.7 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with comparator (placebo and active comparator, sulfonylurea). Three additional cases of pancreatitis were reported following the last administered dose of linagliptin.



   

    Hypoglycemia  In the placebo-controlled studies, 199 (6.6%) of the total 2994 patients treated with TRADJENTA 5 mg reported hypoglycemia compared to 56 patients (3.6%) of 1546 placebo-treated patients. The incidence of hypoglycemia was similar to placebo when TRADJENTA was administered as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, or with pioglitazone. When TRADJENTA was administered in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, 181 of 792 (22.9%) patients reported hypoglycemia compared with 39 of 263 (14.8%) patients administered placebo in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea. Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia.



 In the study of patients receiving TRADJENTA as add-on therapy to a stable dose of insulin for up to 52 weeks (n=1261), no significant difference in the incidence of investigator reported hypoglycemia, defined as all symptomatic or asymptomatic episodes with a self-measured blood glucose <=70 mg/dL, was noted between the TRADJENTA- (31.4%) and placebo- (32.9%) treated groups. During the same time period, severe hypoglycemic events, defined as requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions, were reported in 11 (1.7%) of TRADJENTA treated patients and 7 (1.1%) of placebo treated patients. Events that were considered life-threatening or required hospitalization were reported in 3 (0.5%) patients on TRADJENTA and 1 (0.2%) on placebo.



   Use in Renal Impairment  TRADJENTA was compared to placebo as add-on to pre-existing antidiabetic therapy over 52 weeks in 133 patients with severe renal impairment (estimated GFR <30 mL/min). For the initial 12 weeks of the study, background antidiabetic therapy was kept stable and included insulin, sulfonylurea, glinides, and pioglitazone. For the remainder of the trial, dose adjustments in antidiabetic background therapy were allowed.



 In general, the incidence of adverse events including severe hypoglycemia was similar to those reported in other TRADJENTA trials. The observed incidence of hypoglycemia was higher (TRADJENTA, 63% compared to placebo, 49%) due to an increase in asymptomatic hypoglycemic events especially during the first 12 weeks when background glycemic therapies were kept stable. Ten TRADJENTA-treated patients (15%) and 11 placebo-treated patients (17%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying finger stick glucose <=54 mg/dL). During the same time period, severe hypoglycemic events, defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions, were reported in 3 (4.4%) TRADJENTA-treated patients and 3 (4.6%) placebo-treated patients. Events that were considered life-threatening or required hospitalization were reported in 2 (2.9%) patients on TRADJENTA and 1 (1.5%) patient on placebo.



 Renal function as measured by mean eGFR and creatinine clearance did not change over 52 weeks' treatment compared to placebo.



     Laboratory Tests  

  Changes in laboratory findings were similar in patients treated with TRADJENTA 5 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. Changes in laboratory values that occurred more frequently in the TRADJENTA group and  >  1% more than in the placebo group were increases in uric acid (1.3% in the placebo group, 2.7% in the TRADJENTA group).



 No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs were observed in patients treated with TRADJENTA.



   6.2  Postmarketing Experience

  Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TRADJENTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   EXCERPT:    *  There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue TRADJENTA.  (5.1)   
 *  When used with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin, consider lowering the dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia  (5.2)   
 *  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with TRADJENTA including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. In such cases, promptly discontinue TRADJENTA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes.  (5.3)   
 *  Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.  (5.4)   
 *  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with TRADJENTA or any other antidiabetic drug  (5.5)   
    
 

   5.1  Pancreatitis



  There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, in patients taking TRADJENTA. Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue TRADJENTA and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using TRADJENTA.



    5.2  Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia



  Insulin secretagogues and insulin are known to cause hypoglycemia. The use of TRADJENTA in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia compared with placebo in a clinical trial [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The use of TRADJENTA in combination with insulin in subjects with severe renal impairment was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with TRADJENTA.



    5.3  Hypersensitivity Reactions



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with TRADJENTA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with TRADJENTA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue TRADJENTA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes.



 Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with TRADJENTA.



    5.4  Severe and Disabling Arthralgia



   There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.  



    5.5  Macrovascular Outcomes

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   Patient Exposure  



 BRINTELLIX was evaluated for safety in 4746 patients (18 years to 88 years of age) diagnosed with MDD who participated in pre-marketing clinical studies; 2616 of those patients were exposed to BRINTELLIX in 6 to 8 week, placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 5 mg to 20 mg once daily and 204 patients were exposed to BRINTELLIX in a 24 week to 64 week placebo-controlled maintenance study at doses of 5 mg to 10 mg once daily. Patients from the 6 to 8 week studies continued into 12-month open-label studies. A total of 2586 patients were exposed to at least one dose of BRINTELLIX in open-label studies, 1727 were exposed to BRINTELLIX for six months and 885 were exposed for at least one year.



   Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment  



 In pooled 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies the incidence of patients who received BRINTELLIX 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day and 20 mg/day and discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction was 5%, 6%, 8% and 8%, respectively, compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients. Nausea was the most common adverse reaction reported as a reason for discontinuation.



   Common Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled MDD Studies  



 The most commonly observed adverse reactions in MDD patients treated with BRINTELLIX in 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies (incidence >=5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were nausea, constipation and vomiting.



   Table 2  shows the incidence of common adverse reactions that occurred in >=2% of MDD patients treated with any BRINTELLIX dose and at least 2% more frequently than in placebo-treated patients in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies.

              Nausea  
 

 Nausea was the most common adverse reaction and its frequency was dose-related  (Table 2)  . It was usually considered mild or moderate in intensity and the median duration was 2 weeks. Nausea was more common in females than males. Nausea most commonly occurred in the first week of BRINTELLIX treatment with 15 to 20% of patients experiencing nausea after 1 to 2 days of treatment. Approximately 10% of patients taking BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day had nausea at the end of the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies.



   Sexual Dysfunction  



 Difficulties in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of psychiatric disorders, but they may also be consequences of pharmacologic treatment.



 In the MDD 6 to 8 week controlled trials of BRINTELLIX, voluntarily reported adverse reactions related to sexual dysfunction were captured as individual event terms. These event terms have been aggregated and the overall incidence was as follows. In male patients the overall incidence was 3%, 4%, 4%, 5% in BRINTELLIX 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, 20 mg/day, respectively, compared to 2% in placebo. In female patients, the overall incidence was <1%, 1%, <1%, 2% in BRINTELLIX 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, 20 mg/day, respectively, compared to <1% in placebo.



 Because voluntarily reported adverse sexual reactions are known to be underreported, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them, the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX), a validated measure designed to identify sexual side effects, was used prospectively in seven placebo-controlled trials. The ASEX scale includes five questions that pertain to the following aspects of sexual function: 1) sex drive, 2) ease of arousal, 3) ability to achieve erection (men) or lubrication (women), 4) ease of reaching orgasm, and 5) orgasm satisfaction.



 The presence or absence of sexual dysfunction among patients entering clinical studies was based on their ASEX scores. For patients without sexual dysfunction at baseline (approximately 1/3 of the population across all treatment groups in each study),  Table 3  shows the incidence of patients that developed treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction when treated with BRINTELLIX or placebo in any fixed dose group. Physicians should routinely inquire about possible sexual side effects.

ASEX Incidence of Treatment Emergent Sexual DysfunctionIncidence based on number of subjects with sexual dysfunction during the study / number of subjects without sexual dysfunction at baseline.

              Adverse Reactions Following Abrupt Discontinuation of BRINTELLIX Treatment  
 

 Discontinuation symptoms have been prospectively evaluated in patients taking BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, and 20 mg/day using the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) scale in clinical trials. Some patients experienced discontinuation symptoms such as headache, muscle tension, mood swings, sudden outbursts of anger, dizziness, and runny nose in the first week of abrupt discontinuation of BRINTELLIX 15 mg/day and 20 mg/day.



   Laboratory Tests  



 BRINTELLIX has not been associated with any clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters in serum chemistry (except sodium), hematology and urinalysis as measured in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies. Hyponatremia has been reported with the treatment of BRINTELLIX  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  . In the 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of a long-term study in patients who had responded to BRINTELLIX during the initial 12-week, open-label phase, there were no clinically important changes in lab test parameters between BRINTELLIX and placebo-treated patients.



   Weight  



 BRINTELLIX had no significant effect on body weight as measured by the mean change from baseline in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies. In the 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of a long-term study in patients who had responded to BRINTELLIX during the initial 12-week, open-label phase, there was no significant effect on body weight between BRINTELLIX and placebo-treated patients.



   Vital Signs  



 BRINTELLIX has not been associated with any clinically significant effects on vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, as measured in placebo-controlled studies.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS

  WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS

    Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies. These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24; there was a trend toward reduced risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].    



   In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].    



   BRINTELLIX has not been evaluated for use in pediatric patients   [see   Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].

   5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk



  Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled studies of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a trend toward reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.



 The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term studies of nine antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term studies (median duration of two months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1  .

        No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.
 

 It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.



  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  



 The following symptoms anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.



 Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.



  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.  



  Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder  



 A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled studies) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that BRINTELLIX is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.



    5.2 Serotonin Syndrome



  The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonergic antidepressants including BRINTELLIX, when used alone but more often when used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort), and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).



 Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.



 The concomitant use of BRINTELLIX with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. BRINTELLIX should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking BRINTELLIX. BRINTELLIX should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see  Contraindications (4)      and  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  .



 If concomitant use of BRINTELLIX with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.



 Treatment with BRINTELLIX and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.



    5.3 Abnormal Bleeding



  The use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including BRINTELLIX, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.



 Patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding when BRINTELLIX is coadministered with NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].  



    5.4 Activation of Mania/Hypomania



  Symptoms of mania/hypomania were reported in <0.1% of patients treated with BRINTELLIX in pre-marketing clinical studies. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with other antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, use BRINTELLIX cautiously in patients with a history or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.



    5.5 Angle Closure Glaucoma



   Angle Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including BRINTELLIX, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.  



    5.6 Hyponatremia



  Hyponatremia has occurred as a result of treatment with serotonergic drugs. In many cases, hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). One case with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L was reported in a subject treated with BRINTELLIX in a pre-marketing clinical study. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with a serotonergic antidepressant. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted can be at greater risk. Discontinuation of BRINTELLIX in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 A total of 2047 patients receiving AUBAGIO (7 mg or 14 mg once daily) constituted the safety population in the pooled analysis of placebo controlled studies in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis; of these, 71% were female. The average age was 37 years.



 Table 1 lists adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials with rates that were at least 2% for AUBAGIO patients and also at least 2% above the rate in placebo patients. The most common were headache, an increase in ALT, diarrhea, alopecia, and nausea. The adverse reaction most commonly associated with discontinuation was an increase in ALT (3.3%, 2.6%, and 2.3% of all patients in the AUBAGIO 7 mg, AUBAGIO 14 mg, and placebo treatment arms, respectively).

              Cardiovascular deaths  
 

 Four cardiovascular deaths, including three sudden deaths, and one myocardial infarction in a patient with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension were reported among approximately 2600 patients exposed to AUBAGIO in the premarketing database. These cardiovascular deaths occurred during uncontrolled extension studies, one to nine years after initiation of treatment. A relationship between AUBAGIO and cardiovascular death has not been established.



     Acute Renal Failure  



 In placebo-controlled studies, creatinine values increased more than 100% over baseline in 8/1045 (0.8%) patients in the 7 mg AUBAGIO group and 6/1002 (0.6%) patients in the 14 mg AUBAGIO group versus 4/997 (0.4%) patients in the placebo group. These elevations were transient. Some elevations were accompanied by hyperkalemia. AUBAGIO may cause acute uric acid nephropathy with transient acute renal failure because AUBAGIO increases renal uric acid clearance.



     Hypophosphatemia  



 In clinical trials, 18% of AUBAGIO-treated patients had hypophosphatemia with serum phosphorus levels of at least 0.6 mmol/L, compared to 7% of placebo-treated patients; 4% of AUBAGIO-treated patients had hypophosphatemia with serum phosphorus levels at least 0.3 mmol/L but less than 0.6 mmol/L, compared to 0.8% of placebo-treated patients. No patient in any treatment group had a serum phosphorus below 0.3 mmol/L.

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning  



   Hepatotoxicity  



   Severe liver injury including fatal liver failure has been reported in patients treated with leflunomide, which is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. A similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide because recommended doses of teriflunomide and leflunomide result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Obtain transaminase and bilirubin levels within 6 months before initiation of AUBAGIO and monitor ALT levels at least monthly for six months (  5.1  ). If drug induced liver injury is suspected, discontinue AUBAGIO and start accelerated elimination procedure (  5.3  ).   



   Risk of Teratogenicity  



   Based on animal data, AUBAGIO may cause major birth defects if used during pregnancy. AUBAGIO is contraindicated in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception. Pregnancy must be avoided during AUBAGIO treatment. (  4.2  ,   5.2  )  



 



  Hepatotoxicity

    Severe liver injury including fatal liver failure has been reported in patients treated with leflunomide, which is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. A similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide because recommended doses of teriflunomide and leflunomide result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Concomitant use of AUBAGIO with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs may increase the risk of severe liver injury. Obtain transaminase and bilirubin levels within 6 months before initiation of AUBAGIO therapy. Monitor ALT levels at least monthly for six months after starting AUBAGIO   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].   If drug induced liver injury is suspected, discontinue AUBAGIO and start an accelerated elimination procedure with cholestyramine or charcoal   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  . AUBAGIO is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment   [see   Contraindications (4.1)  ]  . Patients with pre-existing liver disease may be at increased risk of developing elevated serum transaminases when taking AUBAGIO.   



   Risk of Teratogenicity

    Based on animal data, AUBAGIO may cause major birth defects if used during pregnancy. Pregnancy must be excluded before starting AUBAGIO. AUBAGIO is contraindicated in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception. Pregnancy must be avoided during AUBAGIO treatment or prior to the completion of an accelerated elimination procedure after AUBAGIO treatment   [see   Contraindications (4.2)  ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  , and   Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .

AUBAGIO,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Elimination of AUBAGIO can be accelerated by administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal for 11 days (  5.3  ) 
 *  AUBAGIO may decrease WBC. A recent CBC should be available before starting AUBAGIO. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Consider suspending treatment with AUBAGIO in case of serious infection. Do not start AUBAGIO in patients with active infections (  5.4  ) 
 *  If patient develops symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, evaluate patient and consider discontinuing AUBAGIO (  5.5  ) 
 *  Stop AUBAGIO if patient develops Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (  5.6  ) 
 *  AUBAGIO may increase blood pressure. Measure blood pressure at treatment initiation and monitor blood pressure during treatment (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hepatotoxicity



  Severe liver injury including fatal liver failure and dysfunction has been reported in some patients treated with leflunomide, which is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. A similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide because recommended doses of teriflunomide and leflunomide result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Patients with pre-existing liver disease may be at increased risk of developing elevated serum transaminases when taking AUBAGIO. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) before initiating treatment, should not normally be treated with AUBAGIO. AUBAGIO is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see  Contraindications (4.1)  ]  .



  In placebo-controlled trials, ALT greater than three times the ULN occurred in 61/1045 (5.8%) and 62/1002 (6.2%) of patients receiving AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, and 38/997 (3.8%) of patients receiving placebo, during the treatment period. These elevations occurred mostly within the first year of treatment. Half of the cases returned to normal without drug discontinuation. In clinical trials, if ALT elevation was greater than three times the ULN on two consecutive tests, AUBAGIO was discontinued and patients underwent an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  . Of the patients who underwent discontinuation and accelerated elimination in controlled trials, half returned to normal or near normal values within 2 months.  



 One patient in the controlled trials developed ALT 32 times the ULN and jaundice 5 months after initiation of AUBAGIO 14 mg treatment. The patient was hospitalized for 5 weeks and recovered after plasmapheresis and cholestyramine accelerated elimination procedure. AUBAGIO-induced liver injury in this patient could not be ruled out.



 Obtain serum transaminase and bilirubin levels within 6 months before initiation of AUBAGIO therapy. Monitor ALT levels at least monthly for six months after starting AUBAGIO. Consider additional monitoring when AUBAGIO is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Consider discontinuing AUBAGIO if serum transaminase increase (greater than three times the ULN) is confirmed. Monitor serum transaminase and bilirubin on AUBAGIO therapy, particularly in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine. If liver injury is suspected to be AUBAGIO-induced, discontinue AUBAGIO and start an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized. If AUBAGIO-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other probable cause has been found, resumption of AUBAGIO therapy may be considered.



    5.2 Use in Women of Childbearing Potential



  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies evaluating AUBAGIO in pregnant women. However, based on animal studies, teriflunomide may increase the risk of teratogenic effects or fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman [see  Contraindications (4.2)  ]  .



 Women of childbearing potential must not be started on AUBAGIO until pregnancy is excluded and it has been confirmed that they are using reliable contraception. Before starting treatment with AUBAGIO, patients must be fully counseled on the potential for serious risk to the fetus. The patient must be advised that if there is any delay in onset of menses or any other reason to suspect pregnancy, they must notify the physician immediately for pregnancy testing and, if positive, the physician and patient must discuss the risk to the fetus. It is possible that rapidly lowering the plasma concentration of teriflunomide by instituting an accelerated elimination procedure may decrease the risk to the fetus from AUBAGIO [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



 Upon discontinuing AUBAGIO, it is recommended that all women of childbearing potential undergo an accelerated elimination procedure. Women receiving AUBAGIO treatment who wish to become pregnant must discontinue AUBAGIO and undergo an accelerated elimination procedure, which includes verification of teriflunomide plasma concentrations less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL). Human plasma concentrations of teriflunomide less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) are expected to have minimal risk [see  Contraindications (4.2)  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



    5.3 Procedure for Accelerated Elimination of Teriflunomide



  Teriflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma. Without an accelerated elimination procedure, it takes on average 8 months to reach plasma concentrations less than 0.02 mg/L, although because of individual variations in drug clearance it may take as long as 2 years. An accelerated elimination procedure could be used at any time after discontinuation of AUBAGIO. Elimination can be accelerated by either of the following procedures:



 *  Administration of cholestyramine 8 g every 8 hours for 11 days. If cholestyramine 8 g three times a day is not well tolerated, cholestyramine 4 g three times a day can be used. 
 *  Administration of 50 g oral activated charcoal powder every 12 hours for 11 days. 
    If either elimination procedure is poorly tolerated, treatment days do not need to be consecutive unless there is a need to lower teriflunomide plasma concentration rapidly.
 

 At the end of 11 days, both regimens successfully accelerated teriflunomide elimination, leading to more than 98% decrease in teriflunomide plasma concentrations.



 Use of the accelerated elimination procedure may potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to AUBAGIO treatment.



    5.4 Bone Marrow Effects/Immunosuppression Potential/Infections



   White Blood Cell (WBC) count decrease  



  A mean decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count of approximately 15% (mainly neutrophils and lymphocytes) and in platelet count of approximately 10% was observed in placebo-controlled trials with 7 mg and 14 mg of AUBAGIO compared to baseline. The decrease in mean WBC count occurred during the first 6 weeks and WBC count remained low during treatment. In placebo-controlled studies, neutrophil count < 1.5*10  9  /L was observed in 12% and 16% of patients receiving AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, compared with 7% of patients receiving placebo; lymphocyte count <0.8*10  9  /L was observed in 10% and 12% of patients receiving AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, compared with 6% of patients receiving placebo. No cases of serious pancytopenia were reported in premarketing clinical trials of AUBAGIO but rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting with leflunomide. A similar risk would be expected for AUBAGIO [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Obtain a complete blood cell count (CBC) within 6 months before the initiation of treatment with AUBAGIO. Further monitoring should be based on signs and symptoms suggestive of bone marrow suppression.  



    Risk of Infection / Tuberculosis Screening  



 Patients with active acute or chronic infections should not start treatment until the infection(s) is resolved. If a patient develops a serious infection consider suspending treatment with AUBAGIO and using an accelerated elimination procedure. Reassess the benefits and risks prior to resumption of therapy. Instruct patients receiving AUBAGIO to report symptoms of infections to a physician.



 AUBAGIO is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow disease, or severe, uncontrolled infections. Medications like AUBAGIO that have immunosuppression potential may cause patients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections.



  In placebo-controlled studies of AUBAGIO, no overall increase in the risk of serious infections was observed with AUBAGIO 7 mg (2.2%) or 14 mg (2.7%) compared to placebo (2.2%). However, one fatal case of klebsiella pneumonia sepsis occurred in a patient taking AUBAGIO 14 mg for 1.7 years. Fatal infections have been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving leflunomide, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia and aspergillosis. Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid disease, may predispose patients to infection. In clinical studies with AUBAGIO, cytomegalovirus hepatitis reactivation has been observed.  



  In clinical studies with AUBAGIO, cases of tuberculosis have been observed. Prior to initiating AUBAGIO, screen patients for latent tuberculosis infection with a tuberculin skin test or with a blood test for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. AUBAGIO has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of AUBAGIO in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown. For patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening, treat by standard medical practice prior to therapy with AUBAGIO.  



    Vaccination  



 No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of live vaccinations in patients taking AUBAGIO. Vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended. The long half-life of AUBAGIO should be considered when contemplating administration of a live vaccine after stopping AUBAGIO.



    Malignancy  



 The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with the use of some immunosuppressive medications. There is a potential for immunosuppression with AUBAGIO. No apparent increase in the incidence of malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders was reported in the AUBAGIO clinical trials, but larger and longer-term studies would be needed to determine whether there is an increased risk of malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorders with AUBAGIO.



    5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy



   In placebo-controlled studies, peripheral neuropathy, including both polyneuropathy and mononeuropathy (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), occurred more frequently in patients taking AUBAGIO than in patients taking placebo. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy confirmed by nerve conduction studies was 1.4% (13 patients) and 1.9% (17 patients) of patients receiving 7 mg and 14 mg of AUBAGIO, respectively, compared with 0.4% receiving placebo (4 patients). Treatment was discontinued in 0.7% (8 patients) with confirmed peripheral neuropathy (3 patients receiving AUBAGIO 7 mg and 5 patients receiving AUBAGIO 14 mg). Five of them recovered following treatment discontinuation. Not all cases of peripheral neuropathy resolved with continued treatment. Peripheral neuropathy also occurred in patients receiving leflunomide.  



 Age older than 60 years, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increase the risk for peripheral neuropathy .  If a patient taking AUBAGIO develops symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, such as bilateral numbness or tingling of hands or feet, consider discontinuing AUBAGIO therapy and performing an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



    5.6 Skin Reactions



  Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving leflunomide. A similar risk would be expected for AUBAGIO [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . If a patient taking AUBAGIO develops any of these conditions, stop AUBAGIO therapy and perform an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



    5.7 Increased Blood Pressure



   In placebo-controlled studies, the mean change from baseline to the end of study in systolic blood pressure was +2.3 mmHg and +2.7 mmHg for AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, and -0.6 mmHg for placebo. The change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure was +1.4 mmHg and +1.9 mmHg for AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, and -0.3 mmHg for placebo. Hypertension was an adverse reaction in 3.1% and 4.3% of patients treated with 7 mg or 14 mg of AUBAGIO compared with 1.8% for placebo. Check blood pressure before start of AUBAGIO treatment and periodically thereafter. Elevated blood pressure should be appropriately managed during treatment with AUBAGIO.  



    5.8 Respiratory Effects



  Interstitial lung disease and worsening of pre-existing interstitial lung disease have been reported during treatment with leflunomide. A similar risk would be expected for AUBAGIO [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Interstitial lung disease may be fatal. Interstitial lung disease may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has a variable clinical presentation. New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, with or without associated fever, may be a reason for discontinuation of the therapy and for further investigation as appropriate. If discontinuation of the drug is necessary, consider initiation of an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



    5.9 Concomitant Use with Immunosuppressive or Immunomodulating Therapies



  Co-administration with antineoplastic, or immunosuppressive therapies used for treatment of multiple sclerosis has not been evaluated. Safety studies in which AUBAGIO was concomitantly administered with other immune modulating therapies for up to one year (interferon beta, glatiramer acetate) did not reveal any specific safety concerns. The long term safety of these combinations in the treatment of multiple sclerosis has not been established.



 In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from AUBAGIO to another agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds. Use of an accelerated elimination procedure may decrease this risk, but may also potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to AUBAGIO treatment [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Multiple Myeloma  



 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In Trial 1, data were evaluated from 219 patients (safety population) who received treatment with POMALYST + Low-dose Dex (112 patients) or POMALYST alone (107 patients). Median number of treatment cycles was 5. Sixty-seven percent of patients in the study had a dose interruption of either drug due to adverse reactions. Forty-two percent of patients in the study had a dose reduction of either drug due to adverse reactions. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11%.



 In Trial 2, data were evaluated from 450 patients (safety population) who received treatment with POMALYST + Low-dose Dex (300 patients) or High-dose Dexamethasone (High-dose Dex) (150 patients). The median number of treatment cycles for the POMALYST + Low-dose Dex arm was 5. In the POMALYST + Low-dose Dex arm, 67% of patients had a dose interruption of POMALYST, the median time to the first dose interruption of POMALYST was 4.1 weeks. Twenty-seven percent of patients had a dose reduction of POMALYST, the median time to the first dose reduction of POMALYST was 4.5 weeks. Eight percent of patients discontinued POMALYST due to adverse reactions.



   Tables 2  and  3  summarize the adverse reactions reported in Trials 1 and 2, respectively.

   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  POMALYST is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ]. POMALYST is only available through the POMALYST REMS program [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ].



  Females of Reproductive Potential  Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy while taking POMALYST and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy.



 Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with POMALYST, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of POMALYST therapy.



 Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing POMALYST therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in women with regular menstrual cycles, or every 2 weeks in women with irregular menstrual cycles [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  ].



  Males  Pomalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking POMALYST and for up to 28 days after discontinuing POMALYST, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking POMALYST must not donate sperm [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  ].



  Blood Donation  Patients must not donate blood during treatment with POMALYST and for 1 month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to POMALYST.



    5.2 POMALYST REMS Program



  Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )  ], POMALYST is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called "" POMALYST REMS  .""



 Required components of the POMALYST REMS  program include the following:



 *  Prescribers must be certified with the POMALYST REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. 
 *  Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) ]. 
 *  Pharmacies must be certified with the POMALYST REMS program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive POMALYST, and comply with REMS requirements. 
    Further information about the POMALYST REMS  program is available at www.CelgeneRiskManagement.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436.
 

     5.3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism  



   Venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction and stroke) have been observed in patients treated with POMALYST. In Trial 2, where anticoagulant therapies were mandated, thromboembolic events occurred in 8.0% of patients treated with POMALYST and low dose-dexamethasone (Low-dose Dex), and 3.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occurred in 4.7% of patients treated with POMALYST and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Arterial thromboembolic events include terms for arterial thromboembolic events, ischemic cerebrovascular conditions, and ischemic heart disease. Arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 3.0% of patients treated with POMALYST and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone.  



  Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk, and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended, and the choice of regimen should be based on assessment of the patient's underlying risk factors.  



     5.4 Hematologic Toxicity  



   In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3/4 adverse reaction, followed by anemia and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia of any grade was reported in 51% of patients in both trials. The rate of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 46%. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 8%.  



 Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia. Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or modification [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )  ].



     5.5 Hepatotoxicity  



   Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with POMALYST. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin have also been observed in patients treated with POMALYST. Monitor liver function tests monthly. Stop POMALYST upon elevation of liver enzymes and evaluate. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered.  



    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions



   Angioedema and severe dermatologic reactions have been reported. Discontinue POMALYST for angioedema, skin exfoliation, bullae, or any other severe dermatologic reactions, and do not resume therapy [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )  ].  



     5.7 Dizziness and Confusional State  



   In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, 14% of patients experienced dizziness and 7% of patients experienced a confusional state; 1% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 dizziness, and 3% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 confusional state. Instruct patients to avoid situations where dizziness or confusional state may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause dizziness or confusional state without adequate medical advice.  



     5.8 Neuropathy  



   In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, 18% of patients experienced neuropathy, with approximately 12% of the patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy. Two percent of patients experienced Grade 3 neuropathy in trial 2. There were no cases of Grade 4 neuropathy adverse reactions reported in either trial.  



    5.9 Risk of Second Primary Malignancies



  Cases of acute myelogenous leukemia have been reported in patients receiving POMALYST as an investigational therapy outside of multiple myeloma.



    5.10 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



   Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur in patients treated with pomalidomide. Patients at risk for TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken.

SURFAXIN,adverse reactions,"    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions associated with the use of SURFAXIN are endotracheal tube reflux, pallor, endotracheal tube obstruction, and need for dose interruption.  (6.1)  



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Discovery Laboratories, Inc. at 1-877-SURFAXN or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

      Studies in Premature Infants at Risk for Respiratory Distress Syndrome    



 The safety data described below reflect exposure to SURFAXIN at a dose of 5.8 mL per kg (up to 4 doses) administered in either 4 aliquots (Study 1) or 2 aliquots (Study 2) in 643 infants 32 weeks gestational age or less in 2 randomized double-blind, active-controlled clinical studies in which infants could receive up to 4 doses of surfactant intratracheally [  see Clinical Studies  (14)    ]. Study 1 was conducted in 1294 premature infants who weighed between 600 g and 1250 g at birth and were 32 weeks or less in gestational age. Infants received 1 of 3 surfactants, SURFAXIN (N = 524), colfosceril palmitate (N = 506), or beractant (N = 258). Study 2 was conducted in 252 premature infants who weighed between 600 g and 1250 g and were less than 29 weeks in gestational age. Infants received SURFAXIN (N = 119) or poractant alfa (N = 124).



 Comparator surfactants colfosceril palmitate and beractant were administered at the recommended doses (5.0 and 4.0 mL per kg, respectively) while the first dose of poractant alfa administered (2.2 mL per kg) was less than the recommended dose of 2.5 mL per kg. Any subsequent doses of poractant alfa were at the recommended 1.25 mL per kg dose.



 Administration-related adverse reactions (endotracheal tube reflux, pallor, endotracheal tube obstruction, and need for dose interruption) were assessed in both SURFAXIN controlled clinical studies. Overall, the incidence of administration-related adverse reactions was higher in infants who received SURFAXIN compared to other surfactants (Table 2) and resulted in a greater proportion of infants treated with SURFAXIN who experienced administration-related oxygen desaturation and bradycardia. For Study 1, oxygen desaturation was reported in 17%, 9%, and 13% and bradycardia for 5%, 2%, and 3% of infants treated with SURFAXIN, colfosceril palmitate, and beractant, respectively. For Study 2, oxygen desaturation was reported in 8% and 2% and bradycardia in 3% and 2% of infants treated with SURFAXIN and poractant alfa, respectively. These adverse reactions did not appear to be associated with an increased incidence of serious complications or mortality relative to the comparator surfactants (Table 3).

      All-cause mortality through 36-weeks PCA was similar regardless of which exogenous surfactant was administered.
 

 Adverse reactions reported in the controlled clinical studies through 36-weeks PCA occurring in at least 10% of infants were anemia, jaundice, metabolic acidosis, oxygen desaturation, hyperglycemia, pneumonia, hyponatremia, hypotension, respiratory acidosis, and bradycardia. These reactions occurred at rates similar to the comparator surfactants.



 No assessments for immunogenicity to SURFAXIN were performed in these clinical studies.



   Follow-up Evaluations  



 Twelve-month corrected-age follow-up of 1546 infants enrolled in the 2 controlled clinical studies demonstrated no significant differences in mortality or gross neurologic findings between infants treated with SURFAXIN and those treated with the comparator surfactants (colfosceril palmitate, beractant, or poractant alfa).



     Clinical Study in Adults with ARDS    



 The safety and efficacy of lucinactant administered in 2 doses separated by 48 hours via segmental bronchoscopic lavage in adults with ARDS was evaluated in a two-part clinical trial in 124 adult patients. Twenty-two patients were studied in the initial open-label portion of the trial (Part A) and 102 patients participated in a subsequent randomized controlled portion (Part B). Compared to standard of care, patients who received treatment with lucinactant via segmental bronchoscopic lavage at doses up to 50 mL per lung segment had an increased incidence of death, multi-organ failure, sepsis, anoxic encephalopathy, renal failure, hypoxia/decreased oxygen saturation, pneumothorax, hypotension, and pulmonary embolism compared to those patients receiving standard of care. SURFAXIN is not indicated for use in the treatment of ARDS.

SURFAXIN,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Acute Changes in Lung Compliance: Infants receiving SURFAXIN should receive frequent clinical assessments so that oxygen and ventilatory support can be modified to respond to changes in respiratory status.  (5.1)   
 *  Administration-Related Adverse Reactions: If adverse reactions including bradycardia, oxygen desaturation, reflux of SURFAXIN into the endotracheal tube (ETT), and airway/ETT obstruction occur during administration of SURFAXIN, dosing should be interrupted and the infant's clinical condition assessed and stabilized. Suctioning of the ETT or reintubation may be required if airway obstruction persists or is severe.  (5.2)   
 *  Increased Serious Adverse Reactions in Adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Adults with ARDS who received lucinactant via segmental bronchoscopic lavage had an increased incidence of death, multi-organ failure, sepsis, anoxic encephalopathy, renal failure, hypoxia, pneumothorax, hypotension, and pulmonary embolism. SURFAXIN is not indicated for use in ARDS.  (5.3)   
    
 

   5.1 Acute Changes in Lung Compliance



  Administration of exogenous surfactants, including SURFAXIN, can rapidly affect lung compliance and oxygenation. SURFAXIN should be administered only by clinicians trained and experienced in the resuscitation, intubation, stabilization, and ventilatory management of premature infants in a clinical setting with the capacity to care for critically ill neonates. Infants receiving SURFAXIN should receive frequent clinical assessments so that oxygen and ventilatory support can be modified to respond to changes in respiratory status.



    5.2 Administration-Related Adverse Reactions



  Frequently occurring adverse reactions related to the administration of SURFAXIN include bradycardia, oxygen desaturation, reflux of drug into the endotracheal tube (ETT), and airway/ETT obstruction. If any of these events occur, dosing with SURFAXIN should be interrupted and the infant's clinical condition assessed and stabilized. Suctioning of the ETT or reintubation may be required if airway obstruction persists or is severe. After the patient is stable, dosing may proceed with appropriate monitoring.



    5.3 Increased Serious Adverse Reactions in Adults with ARDS



  In a two-part clinical trial in adult patients with ARDS, compared to standard of care, patients who received lucinactant via segmental bronchoscopic lavage had an increased incidence of death, multi-organ failure, sepsis, anoxic encephalopathy, renal failure, hypoxia, pneumothorax, hypotension, and pulmonary embolism. SURFAXIN is not indicated for use in the treatment of ARDS.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Previously Untreated CLL:  The safety of ARZERRA was evaluated in an open-label, parallel-arm, randomized trial (Study 1) in 444 patients with previously untreated CLL. Patients were randomized to receive either ARZERRA as an intravenous infusion every 28 days in combination with chlorambucil (n = 217) or chlorambucil as a single agent (n = 227). In both arms, patients received chlorambucil 10 mg/m2 orally on Days 1 to 7 every 28 days. The infusion schedule for ARZERRA was 300 mg administered on Cycle 1 Day 1, 1,000 mg administered on Cycle 1 Day 8, and 1,000 mg administered on Day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles. The median number of cycles of ARZERRA completed was 6.



 The data described in Table 3 include relevant adverse reactions occurring up to 60 days after the last dose of study medication; Table 4 includes relevant hematologic laboratory abnormalities.

             Infusion Reactions:  Overall, 67% of patients who received ARZERRA in combination with chlorambucil experienced one or more symptoms of infusion reactions (10% were Grade 3 or greater; none were fatal). Infusion reactions that were either Grade 3 or greater, serious, or led to treatment interruption or discontinuation occurred most frequently during Cycle 1 (56% on Day 1 [6% were Grade 3 or greater] and 23% on Day 8 [3% were Grade 3 or greater]) and decreased with subsequent infusions. Infusion reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 3% of patients. Serious adverse events of infusion reactions occurred in 2% of patients.
 

   Neutropenia:  Overall, 3% of patients had neutropenia as a serious adverse event, reported up to 60 days after the last dose. One patient died with neutropenic sepsis and agranulocytosis. Prolonged neutropenia occurred in 6% of patients receiving ARZERRA in combination with chlorambucil compared with 4% of patients receiving chlorambucil. Late-onset neutropenia occurred in 6% of patients receiving ARZERRA in combination with chlorambucil compared with 1% of patients receiving chlorambucil alone.



   Refractory CLL:  The safety of monotherapy with ARZERRA was evaluated in 181 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL in 2 open-label, non-randomized, single-arm studies. In these studies, ARZERRA was administered at 2,000 mg beginning with the second dose for 11 doses (Study 2 [n = 154]) or 3 doses (Study 3 [n = 27]).



 The data described in Table 5 and other sections below are derived from 154 patients in Study 2. All patients received 2,000 mg weekly from the second dose onward. Ninety percent of patients received at least 8 infusions of ARZERRA and 55% received all 12 infusions. The median age was 63 years (range: 41 to 86 years), 72% were male, and 97% were white.

   Infusion Reactions:  Infusion reactions occurred in 44% of patients on the day of the first infusion (300 mg), 29% on the day of the second infusion (2,000 mg), and less frequently during subsequent infusions.



   Infections  : A total of 108 patients (70%) experienced bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. A total of 45 patients (29%) experienced Grade 3 or greater infections, of which 19 (12%) were fatal. The proportion of fatal infections in the fludarabine- and alemtuzumab-refractory group was 17%.



   Neutropenia:  Of 108 patients with normal neutrophil counts at baseline, 45 (42%) developed Grade 3 or greater neutropenia. Nineteen (18%) developed Grade 4 neutropenia. Some patients experienced new onset Grade 4 neutropenia >2 weeks in duration.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  There is a potential for immunogenicity with therapeutic proteins such as ofatumumab. Serum samples from more than 300 patients with CLL were tested during and after treatment for antibodies to ARZERRA. There was no formation of anti-ofatumumab antibodies in patients with CLL after treatment with ofatumumab.



 Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to ARZERRA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ARZERRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   5.1 Infusion Reactions



  ARZERRA can cause serious, including fatal, infusion reactions manifesting as bronchospasm, dyspnea, laryngeal edema, pulmonary edema, flushing, hypertension, hypotension, syncope, cardiac events (e.g., myocardial ischemia/infarction, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, bradycardia), back pain, abdominal pain, pyrexia, rash, urticaria, angioedema, cytokine release syndrome, and anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions. Infusion reactions occur more frequently with the first 2 infusions. These reactions may result in temporary interruption or withdrawal of treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .



 Premedicate with acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]  . Infusion reactions may occur despite premedication. Interrupt infusion with ARZERRA for infusion reactions of any severity. Institute medical management for severe infusion reactions including angina or other signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  . If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue ARZERRA and initiate appropriate medical treatment.



     5.2 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation  



   Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, has occurred in patients treated with ARZERRA. Cases have been reported in patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in patients who are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive. Reactivation also has occurred in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive, and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] positive).  



  HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels and, in severe cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death.  



  Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with ARZERRA. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy.  



  Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following treatment with ARZERRA. HBV reactivation has been reported for at least 12 months following completion of therapy.  



  In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while receiving ARZERRA, immediately discontinue ARZERRA and any concomitant chemotherapy, and institute appropriate treatment. Resumption of ARZERRA in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming ARZERRA in patients who develop HBV reactivation.  



     5.3 Hepatitis B Virus Infection  



   Fatal infection due to hepatitis B in patients who have not been previously infected has been observed with ARZERRA. Monitor patients for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis.  



     5.4 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  



   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in death has occurred with ARZERRA. Consider PML in any patient with new onset of or changes in pre-existing neurological signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, discontinue ARZERRA and initiate evaluation for PML including neurology consultation  .



     5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome  



   Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including the need for hospitalization, has occurred in patients treated with ARZERRA. Patients with high tumor burden and/or high circulating lymphocyte counts (>25 x 10  9  /L) are at greater risk for developing TLS. Consider tumor lysis prophylaxis with anti-hyperuricemics and hydration beginning 12 to 24 hours prior to infusion of ARZERRA. For treatment of TLS, administer aggressive intravenous hydration and anti-hyperuricemic agents, correct electrolyte abnormalities, and monitor renal function  .



    5.6 Cytopenias



  Severe cytopenias, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, can occur with ARZERRA. Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and fatal neutropenic sepsis have occurred in patients who received ARZERRA in combination with chlorambucil. Grade 3 or 4 late-onset neutropenia (onset at least 42 days after last treatment dose) and/or prolonged neutropenia (not resolved between 24 and 42 days after last treatment dose) were reported in patients who received ARZERRA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  Monitor complete blood counts at regular intervals during and after conclusion of therapy, and increase the frequency of monitoring in patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias.



    5.7 Immunizations



  The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following administration of ARZERRA has not been studied. Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received ARZERRA. The ability to generate an immune response to any vaccine following administration of ARZERRA has not been studied.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of pirfenidone has been evaluated in more than 1400 subjects with over 170 subjects exposed to pirfenidone for more than 5 years in clinical trials.



 ESBRIET was studied in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3) in which a total of 623 patients received 2403 mg/day of ESBRIET and 624 patients received placebo. Subjects ages ranged from 40 to 80 years (mean age of 67 years). Most patients were male (74%) and Caucasian (95%). The mean duration of exposure to ESBRIET was 62 weeks (range: 2 to 118 weeks) in these 3 trials.



 At the recommended dosage of 2403 mg/day, 14.6% of patients on ESBRIET compared to 9.6% on placebo permanently discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The most common (>1%) adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were rash and nausea. The most common (>3%) adverse reactions leading to dosage reduction or interruption were rash, nausea, diarrhea, and photosensitivity reaction.



 The most common adverse reactions with an incidence of >=10% and more frequent in the ESBRIET than placebo treatment group are listed in  Table 2  .

ESBRIET,warnings and precautions,"    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



     EXCERPT:    *  Elevated liver enzymes: ALT, AST, and bilirubin elevations have occurred with ESBRIET. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before and during treatment. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. (  2.1  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Photosensitivity and rash: Photosensitivity and rash have been noted with ESBRIET. Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen and protective clothing daily. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and abdominal pain have occurred with ESBRIET. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Elevated Liver Enzymes



  Increases in ALT and AST >3 * ULN have been reported in patients treated with ESBRIET. Rarely these have been associated with concomitant elevations in bilirubin. Patients treated with ESBRIET 2403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 trials had a higher incidence of elevations in ALT or AST >=3 * ULN than placebo patients (3.7% vs. 0.8%, respectively). Elevations >=10 * ULN in ALT or AST occurred in 0.3% of patients in the ESBRIET 2403 mg/day group and in 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. Increases in ALT and AST >=3 * ULN were reversible with dose modification or treatment discontinuation. No cases of liver transplant or death due to liver failure that were related to ESBRIET have been reported. However, the combination of transaminase elevations and elevated bilirubin without evidence of obstruction is generally recognized as an important predictor of severe liver injury, that could lead to death or the need for liver transplants in some patients. Conduct liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to the initiation of therapy with ESBRIET in all patients, then monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Dosage modifications or interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations   [see Dosage and Administration (2.1,    2.3)].    



    5.2 Photosensitivity Reaction or Rash



  Patients treated with ESBRIET 2403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 studies had a higher incidence of photosensitivity reactions (9%) compared with patients treated with placebo (1%). The majority of the photosensitivity reactions occurred during the initial 6 months. Instruct patients to avoid or minimize exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps), to use a sunblock (SPF 50 or higher), and to wear clothing that protects against sun exposure. Additionally, instruct patients to avoid concomitant medications known to cause photosensitivity. Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be necessary in some cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash   [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]    .



    5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders



  In the clinical studies, gastrointestinal events of nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and abdominal pain were more frequently reported by patients in the ESBRIET treatment groups than in those taking placebo. Dosage reduction or interruption for gastrointestinal events was required in 18.5% of patients in the 2403 mg/day group, as compared to 5.8% of patients in the placebo group; 2.2% of patients in the ESBRIET 2403 mg/day group discontinued treatment due to a gastrointestinal event, as compared to 1.0% in the placebo group. The most common (>2%) gastrointestinal events that led to dosage reduction or interruption were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and dyspepsia. The incidence of gastrointestinal events was highest early in the course of treatment (with highest incidence occurring during the initial 3 months) and decreased over time. Dosage modifications may be necessary in some cases of gastrointestinal adverse reactions   [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]    .
