  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Multiple Myeloma  



 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In Trial 1, data were evaluated from 219 patients (safety population) who received treatment with POMALYST + Low-dose Dex (112 patients) or POMALYST alone (107 patients). Median number of treatment cycles was 5. Sixty-seven percent of patients in the study had a dose interruption of either drug due to adverse reactions. Forty-two percent of patients in the study had a dose reduction of either drug due to adverse reactions. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11%.



 In Trial 2, data were evaluated from 450 patients (safety population) who received treatment with POMALYST + Low-dose Dex (300 patients) or High-dose Dexamethasone (High-dose Dex) (150 patients). The median number of treatment cycles for the POMALYST + Low-dose Dex arm was 5. In the POMALYST + Low-dose Dex arm, 67% of patients had a dose interruption of POMALYST, the median time to the first dose interruption of POMALYST was 4.1 weeks. Twenty-seven percent of patients had a dose reduction of POMALYST, the median time to the first dose reduction of POMALYST was 4.5 weeks. Eight percent of patients discontinued POMALYST due to adverse reactions.



   Tables 2  and  3  summarize the adverse reactions reported in Trials 1 and 2, respectively.

</Section>
    <Section name="warnings and precautions" id="S3">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hematologic Toxicity: Neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3/4 adverse event. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia (  5.4  ). 
 *  Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure including fatalities; monitor liver function tests monthly (  5.5  ). 
 *  Hypersensitivity Reactions: Angioedema and severe dermatologic reactions have been reported. Discontinue POMALYST for angioedema and severe dermatologic reactions (  5.6  ). 
 *  Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Monitor patients at risk of TLS (i.e., those with high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions (  5.10  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  POMALYST is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ]. POMALYST is only available through the POMALYST REMS program [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ].



  Females of Reproductive Potential  Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy while taking POMALYST and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy.



 Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with POMALYST, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of POMALYST therapy.



 Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing POMALYST therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in women with regular menstrual cycles, or every 2 weeks in women with irregular menstrual cycles [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  ].



  Males  Pomalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking POMALYST and for up to 28 days after discontinuing POMALYST, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking POMALYST must not donate sperm [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  ].



  Blood Donation  Patients must not donate blood during treatment with POMALYST and for 1 month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to POMALYST.



    5.2 POMALYST REMS Program



  Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )  ], POMALYST is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called " POMALYST REMS  ."



 Required components of the POMALYST REMS  program include the following:



 *  Prescribers must be certified with the POMALYST REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. 
 *  Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) ]. 
 *  Pharmacies must be certified with the POMALYST REMS program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive POMALYST, and comply with REMS requirements. 
    Further information about the POMALYST REMS  program is available at www.CelgeneRiskManagement.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436.
 

     5.3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism  



   Venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction and stroke) have been observed in patients treated with POMALYST. In Trial 2, where anticoagulant therapies were mandated, thromboembolic events occurred in 8.0% of patients treated with POMALYST and low dose-dexamethasone (Low-dose Dex), and 3.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occurred in 4.7% of patients treated with POMALYST and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Arterial thromboembolic events include terms for arterial thromboembolic events, ischemic cerebrovascular conditions, and ischemic heart disease. Arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 3.0% of patients treated with POMALYST and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone.  



  Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk, and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended, and the choice of regimen should be based on assessment of the patient's underlying risk factors.  



     5.4 Hematologic Toxicity  



   In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3/4 adverse reaction, followed by anemia and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia of any grade was reported in 51% of patients in both trials. The rate of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 46%. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 8%.  



 Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia. Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or modification [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )  ].



     5.5 Hepatotoxicity  



   Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with POMALYST. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin have also been observed in patients treated with POMALYST. Monitor liver function tests monthly. Stop POMALYST upon elevation of liver enzymes and evaluate. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered.  



    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions



   Angioedema and severe dermatologic reactions have been reported. Discontinue POMALYST for angioedema, skin exfoliation, bullae, or any other severe dermatologic reactions, and do not resume therapy [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )  ].  



     5.7 Dizziness and Confusional State  



   In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, 14% of patients experienced dizziness and 7% of patients experienced a confusional state; 1% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 dizziness, and 3% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 confusional state. Instruct patients to avoid situations where dizziness or confusional state may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause dizziness or confusional state without adequate medical advice.  



     5.8 Neuropathy  



   In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, 18% of patients experienced neuropathy, with approximately 12% of the patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy. Two percent of patients experienced Grade 3 neuropathy in trial 2. There were no cases of Grade 4 neuropathy adverse reactions reported in either trial.  



    5.9 Risk of Second Primary Malignancies



  Cases of acute myelogenous leukemia have been reported in patients receiving POMALYST as an investigational therapy outside of multiple myeloma.



    5.10 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



   Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur in patients treated with pomalidomide. Patients at risk for TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken.
